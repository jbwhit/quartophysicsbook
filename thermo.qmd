# Thermodynamics

## Temperature and Heat

### Temperature

Temperature measures how hot or cold something is — more precisely, it determines the direction of heat flow between two systems in thermal contact.

A **thermometer** works by exploiting a physical property that varies with temperature (e.g., the volume of a gas at constant pressure). The **constant-volume gas thermometer** defines temperature via the pressure of a gas at fixed volume:

$$T_\text{gas} = T_\text{ref} \frac{P}{P_\text{ref}} \quad \text{(proportional to pressure)}$$

At the **triple point of water** ($T_\text{trip} = 273.16\;\text{K}$), we fix the scale. As gas pressure is reduced to zero, all gas thermometers converge — this defines the **ideal gas temperature scale**.

### Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

Why do different thermometers agree? The **zeroth law**:

> If systems A and B are each in thermal equilibrium with system C, then A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

This guarantees that temperature is well-defined and standardized. The Celsius scale is related to Kelvin by:

$$T_C = T_K - 273.15\;\text{K}$$

### Heat

**Heat** ($Q$) is the transfer of thermal energy, measured in joules. Heat flows between two bodies that are not in thermal equilibrium — always from hot to cold.

### Heat Transfer

There are three ways heat can flow:

**Conduction** — heat flows through a material without bulk motion. The rate of heat flow:

$$H = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{kA\,\Delta T}{\Delta x}$$

where $k$ is the thermal conductivity, $A$ the cross-sectional area, $\Delta T$ the temperature difference, and $\Delta x$ the thickness.

**Radiation** — heat transfer via electromagnetic waves. The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the radiated intensity:

$$I = \varepsilon \sigma T^4$$

where $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}\;\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-2}\,\text{K}^{-4}$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and $\varepsilon$ is the emissivity ($0 \le \varepsilon \le 1$; $\varepsilon = 1$ for a blackbody). Radiated power is proportional to $T^4$.

**Convection** — heat transfer by bulk fluid motion. Heated fluid becomes less dense and rises in bubbles (turbulence, convection cells). This drives radiators, atmospheric circulation, and many other phenomena.

### Thermal Expansion

Most materials expand when heated.

**Linear expansion**: for a rod of length $L$,

$$\Delta L = \alpha L \Delta T$$

where $\alpha$ is the coefficient of linear expansion. Note that holes get bigger too.

**Volume expansion**: for a solid with dimensions $a \times b \times c$,

$$V = abc, \qquad V + \Delta V = (a + \alpha a \Delta T)(b + \alpha b \Delta T)(c + \alpha c \Delta T)$$

Expanding and keeping only first-order terms in $\Delta T$:

$$\Delta V \approx 3\alpha V \Delta T = \beta V \Delta T$$

where $\beta \approx 3\alpha$ is the coefficient of volume expansion.

For **liquids** (no linear expansion applies), $\Delta V = \beta V \Delta T$ directly. Note that $\beta$ is generally temperature-dependent, and for water, $\beta > 0$ usually but $\beta < 0$ near $4°\text{C}$ (water's anomalous expansion).

### Phases and Latent Heat

Matter exists in three common phases: **solid**, **liquid**, and **gas**. Phase transitions occur at specific temperatures and pressures.

**Latent heat** ($\ell$) is the heat per kilogram required for a phase change:

- $\ell_f$ — latent heat of fusion (solid $\leftrightarrow$ liquid)
- $\ell_v$ — latent heat of vaporization (liquid $\leftrightarrow$ gas)

### Heat Capacity

**Heat capacity** $C$ is the heat required to raise the temperature of a system by one degree:

$$C = \frac{\delta Q}{\delta T} \quad [\text{J/K}] \quad \text{(extensive)}$$

**Specific heat capacity** $c$ is heat capacity per unit mass (or per mole):

$$\delta Q = mc\,\delta T, \qquad c = \frac{C}{m} \quad [\text{J/(kg·K)}] \quad \text{(intensive)}$$

### First Law of Thermodynamics

For a process between two equilibrium states A and B, the quantity $Q + W$ is the same regardless of the path taken:

$$\Delta U = Q + W$$

where $Q$ is heat added to the system and $W$ is work done on the system. Internal energy $U$ is a **state function** — it depends only on the current state, not on how the system got there.


## Ideal Gas and Kinetic Theory

### The Ideal Gas Law

An **ideal gas** satisfies:

$$\boxed{PV = NkT = nRT}$$

where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $P$ | Pressure |
| $V$ | Volume |
| $N$ | Number of molecules |
| $n$ | Number of moles |
| $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23}\;\text{J/K}$ | Boltzmann constant |
| $R = 8.314\;\text{J/(K·mol)}$ | Gas constant |
| $N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}\;\text{mol}^{-1}$ | Avogadro's number |

: Ideal Gas Parameters {.striped .hover}

Note $R = N_A k$.

**Assumptions** of the ideal gas model:

1. Particles have negligible volume and exert no long-range forces
2. Total number of particles is large
3. Newtonian mechanics applies
4. Interactions occur through collisions of negligible duration
5. Equipartition theorem holds

### Equipartition Theorem

On average, each degree of freedom contributes $\frac{1}{2}kT$ of energy per molecule:

$$\varepsilon = \frac{f}{2}kT$$

where $f$ is the number of degrees of freedom.

| Molecule | $f$ | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Monatomic | 3 | He (3 translational) |
| Diatomic | 5 | N$_2$ (3 translational + 2 rotational) |
| Polyatomic | 6 | H$_2$O (3 translational + 3 rotational) |

: Degrees of Freedom {.striped .hover}

The total internal energy of an ideal gas is:

$$\boxed{U = \frac{f}{2}NkT = \frac{f}{2}nRT}$$

### Kinetic Theory of Gases

Consider $N$ molecules in a box of side $L$. A molecule with velocity $v_x$ bouncing off a wall transfers momentum $\Delta p = 2mv_x$ each round trip (time $\Delta t = 2L/v_x$).

The force from one molecule:

$$F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{2mv_x}{2L/v_x} = \frac{mv_x^2}{L}$$

Summing over all $N$ molecules and using $P = F/A = F/L^2$:

$$P = \frac{Nm\overline{v_x^2}}{L^3} = \frac{Nm\overline{v_x^2}}{V}$$

Since the motion is isotropic, $\overline{v_x^2} = \frac{1}{3}\overline{v^2}$, so:

$$\boxed{P = \frac{1}{3}\frac{Nm\overline{v^2}}{V} = \frac{1}{3}\rho v_\text{rms}^2}$$

where $v_\text{rms} = \sqrt{\overline{v^2}}$ is the root-mean-square speed.

### Dalton's Law

For a mixture of gases, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:

$$P_\text{total} = \sum_i P_i$$

### RMS Speed

From $P = NkT/V$ and $P = \frac{1}{3}Nm\overline{v^2}/V$:

$$\frac{1}{2}m\overline{v^2} = \frac{3}{2}kT \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad v_\text{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}$$

The total translational kinetic energy is:

$$K_\text{trans} = \frac{3}{2}NkT = \frac{3}{2}PV$$


## Thermodynamic Processes

### PV Diagrams and Work

The first law of thermodynamics:

$$dU = \delta Q + \delta W$$

where $U$ is a state function (path-independent). On a PV diagram, the work done *on* the gas is:

$$\boxed{W = -\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P\,dV = -\text{(area under curve)}}$$

The sign convention: $W > 0$ when work is done *on* the gas (compression), $W < 0$ when the gas expands.

### Special Processes

| Process | Condition | Work | Heat |
|---------|-----------|------|------|
| **Isochoric** | $dV = 0$ | $W = 0$ | $Q = \Delta U$ |
| **Isobaric** | $dP = 0$ | $W = -P\Delta V$ | $Q = \Delta U + P\Delta V$ |
| **Isothermal** | $dT = 0$, $PV = \text{const}$ | $W = -NkT\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}$ | $Q = -W$ |
| **Adiabatic** | $\delta Q = 0$ | $W = \Delta U$ | $Q = 0$ |

: Thermodynamic Processes {.striped .hover}

### Isothermal Process

For an ideal gas at constant temperature ($PV = NkT = \text{const}$):

$$W_\text{isotherm} = -\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \frac{NkT}{V}\,dV = -NkT\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}$$

Since $dT = 0$, the internal energy doesn't change ($\Delta U = 0$ for an ideal gas), so:

$$Q = -W = NkT\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}$$

### Specific Heat Capacities

**At constant volume** ($dV = 0$, so $W = 0$):

$$dU = \delta Q = nC_v\,dT$$

Since $U = \frac{f}{2}nRT$, we get $dU = \frac{f}{2}nR\,dT$, giving:

$$\boxed{C_v = \frac{f}{2}R}$$

**At constant pressure** ($dP = 0$):

$$dU = \delta Q + \delta W = nC_p\,dT - P\,dV$$

Using $PV = nRT$, at constant pressure $P\,dV = nR\,dT$. Then:

$$\frac{f}{2}nR\,dT = nC_p\,dT - nR\,dT$$

$$\boxed{C_p = \left(\frac{f}{2} + 1\right)R}$$

The **heat capacity ratio**:

$$\boxed{\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{f + 2}{f}}$$

| Gas type | $f$ | $\gamma$ |
|----------|------|----------|
| Monatomic | 3 | 5/3 |
| Diatomic | 5 | 7/5 |
| Polyatomic | 6 | 4/3 |

: Heat Capacity Ratios {.striped .hover}

### Adiabatic Process

For an adiabatic process ($\delta Q = 0$), starting from the first law and using $dU = \frac{f}{2}nR\,dT$:

$$dU = \delta W = -P\,dV$$

$$\frac{f}{2}nR\,dT = -P\,dV$$

Using $d(PV) = P\,dV + V\,dP = nR\,dT$, we can write:

$$\frac{f}{2}(P\,dV + V\,dP) = -P\,dV$$

$$\frac{f}{2}V\,dP = -\left(\frac{f}{2} + 1\right)P\,dV$$

$$\frac{dP}{P} = -\gamma\frac{dV}{V}$$

Integrating:

$$\ln P + \gamma \ln V = \text{const}$$

$$\boxed{PV^\gamma = \text{constant}}$$

On a PV diagram, adiabats are steeper than isotherms (since $\gamma > 1$).

## Heat Engines and the Carnot Cycle

### Heat Engines

A **heat engine** absorbs heat $|Q_H|$ from a hot reservoir, does work $|W|$, and rejects heat $|Q_C|$ to a cold reservoir. By conservation of energy:

$$|Q_H| = |W| + |Q_C|$$

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Schematic of a heat engine: hot reservoir ($T_H$) at top, cold reservoir ($T_C$) at bottom, engine in middle with arrows showing $Q_H$ in, $W$ out, $Q_C$ out.
:::

The **efficiency** of a heat engine:

$$e = \frac{|W|}{|Q_H|} = \frac{|Q_H| - |Q_C|}{|Q_H|} = 1 - \frac{|Q_C|}{|Q_H|}$$

### Refrigerators

A **refrigerator** is a heat engine run in reverse: it uses work $|W|$ to transfer heat from cold to hot.

The **coefficient of performance**:

$$K = \frac{|Q_C|}{|W|} = \frac{|Q_C|}{|Q_H| - |Q_C|}$$

### Second Law of Thermodynamics

**Kelvin–Planck form**: No process can convert heat completely into work (no perfect heat engine).

**Clausius form**: No process can transfer heat from cold to hot with no other effect (no perfect refrigerator).

These two statements are equivalent.

### The Carnot Cycle

Carnot constructed a conceptual engine from two isotherms and two adiabats:

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
PV diagram of Carnot cycle: four stages labeled A→B (isothermal expansion at $T_H$), B→C (adiabatic expansion), C→D (isothermal compression at $T_C$), D→A (adiabatic compression). Shaded area = net work.
:::

1. **A → B**: Isothermal expansion at $T_H$ (absorb $Q_H$)
2. **B → C**: Adiabatic expansion ($T_H \to T_C$)
3. **C → D**: Isothermal compression at $T_C$ (reject $Q_C$)
4. **D → A**: Adiabatic compression ($T_C \to T_H$)

For the isothermal stages:

$$Q_{AB} = NkT_H \ln\frac{V_B}{V_A} > 0, \qquad Q_{CD} = NkT_C \ln\frac{V_D}{V_C} < 0$$

For the adiabatic stages, $PV^\gamma = \text{const}$ with $PV = NkT$ gives $TV^{\gamma-1} = \text{const}$:

$$T_H V_B^{\gamma-1} = T_C V_C^{\gamma-1}, \qquad T_H V_A^{\gamma-1} = T_C V_D^{\gamma-1}$$

Dividing: $\frac{V_B}{V_A} = \frac{V_C}{V_D}$, so the logarithms in $Q_{AB}$ and $Q_{CD}$ have the same magnitude. The efficiency:

$$e = 1 - \frac{|Q_C|}{|Q_H|} = 1 - \frac{T_C \ln(V_C/V_D)}{T_H \ln(V_B/V_A)} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$

$$\boxed{e_\text{Carnot} = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}}$$

### Carnot Refrigerator

Running the Carnot cycle in reverse gives a refrigerator with coefficient of performance:

$$\boxed{K_\text{Carnot} = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C}}$$

### Carnot's Theorem

> The efficiency of any heat engine operating between two temperatures can never exceed the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between the same two temperatures.

**Proof by contradiction**: Suppose an engine has efficiency $e' > e_\text{Carnot}$. Use it to drive a Carnot refrigerator. The combined system would transfer heat from cold to hot with no work input — violating the Clausius form of the second law.

The same argument shows that the Carnot refrigerator has the highest possible coefficient of performance.

### Key Property of the Carnot Cycle

For any Carnot cycle:

$$\frac{|Q_H|}{T_H} = \frac{|Q_C|}{T_C}, \qquad \text{or equivalently} \qquad \frac{Q_H}{T_H} + \frac{Q_C}{T_C} = 0$$

The Carnot cycle is **reversible**. Any reversible process can be approximated as a sum of infinitesimal Carnot cycles, which means:

$$\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} = 0 \quad \text{(for any reversible cycle)}$$


## Entropy

### Entropy as a State Function

Since $\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} = 0$ for reversible processes, $\frac{\delta Q}{T}$ defines an exact differential for a state function — **entropy**:

$$dS = \frac{\delta Q_\text{rev}}{T}$$

The entropy change between two states A and B is:

$$\Delta S = \int_A^B \frac{\delta Q_\text{rev}}{T}$$

and is independent of the path taken (as long as we use a reversible path to calculate it).

### Second Law in Terms of Entropy

For a reversible process, $\Delta S_\text{system} + \Delta S_\text{surroundings} = 0$.

For an irreversible process, consider heat flow: if $T_\text{sys} < T_\text{surr}$ (heat flows in), then $dQ_\text{sys} > 0$ and $dQ_\text{surr} < 0$, with $|dQ_\text{surr}/T_\text{surr}| < |dQ_\text{sys}/T_\text{sys}|$ since $T_\text{surr} > T_\text{sys}$. Therefore:

$$\boxed{\Delta S_\text{universe} \ge 0}$$

with equality only for reversible processes. This is the **second law of thermodynamics**: in any process between equilibrium states, the total entropy of the universe cannot decrease.

### Entropy and Adiabatic Processes

For an adiabatic process, $\delta Q = 0$, so $dS = \delta Q/T = 0$. A reversible adiabatic process is therefore **isentropic** ($\Delta S = 0$).

### The Carnot Cycle on a T–S Diagram

On a temperature-entropy ($T$–$S$) diagram, the Carnot cycle is a rectangle:

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram

:::

The heat exchanged is:

$$Q = \int T\,dS = \text{area under curve on T–S diagram}$$

The net work equals the enclosed area of the cycle on the T–S diagram (just as it equals the enclosed area on the PV diagram).


## Phase Diagrams

### Ideal vs Real Gases

The ideal gas law $PV = NkT$ is an excellent approximation in many regimes but fails at **extremes** — very high pressure or very low temperature — where intermolecular forces and finite molecular volume matter. Under these conditions, gases can **liquefy**.

### Phase Diagram

A **phase diagram** plots pressure vs temperature, showing the regions where each phase (solid, liquid, gas) is stable.

Key features:

- **Triple point**: the unique $(P, T)$ where all three phases coexist in equilibrium
- **Critical point**: beyond this, no distinction between liquid and gas (supercritical fluid)
- **Lines of coexistence**: boundaries between phases (sublimation, melting, boiling lines)
- For **water**, the melting curve has a negative slope (ice is less dense than water), which is unusual

### Phase Transitions on a T–S Diagram

During a constant-pressure phase change:

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram

:::

- Temperature increases until the phase boundary is reached
- During the phase change, temperature remains constant while entropy increases (latent heat is absorbed: $\Delta S = Q/T = m\ell/T$)
- After the phase change completes, temperature rises again

The **van der Waals model** accounts for intermolecular attraction and finite molecular volume, providing a qualitative description of the gas-to-liquid transition.
