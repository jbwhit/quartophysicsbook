### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Conservation of Energy (E is conserved).

$$U_{gpe} \rightarrow U_{E}$$

$$mgH = mgh + \frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$$


### Derivation {.unnumbered}

$$F = -kx$$

$$\begin{aligned}
U &= -\int F \, \textnormal{d}x\\
&= -\int_{x_i}^{x_{f}} k x \, \textnormal{d}x\\
&= \frac{1}{2}k x_f^2
\end{aligned}$$

### Determination {.unnumbered}

$$mg\left(H -h\right) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$$

$$\frac{2mg\left(H -h\right)}{k} = x^2$$

$$\boxed{x = \sqrt{\frac{2mg(H-h)}{k}}}$$

### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

$$\begin{aligned}
L &= \sqrt{\frac{M L T^{-2} \left(L\right)}{M T^{-2}}}\\
&= \sqrt{L^2}
\end{aligned}$$

### Limiting Cases {.unnumbered}
$$H \rightarrow h$$ 

$$ H - h = 0 \implies x=0$$ makes sense!

$$m \rightarrow 0 \implies x \rightarrow 0$$ makes sense!

$$k \rightarrow \infty \implies x \rightarrow 0$$ makes sense!

$$k \rightarrow 0 \implies x \rightarrow \infty$$ makes sense!

### Substitution {.unnumbered}
Not needed.




## Example Problem {.numbered}
**Title:** Acceleration and Tension in a Two-Mass Pulley System on an Incline

A system consists of two masses, a man $m$ and piano $M$, where $m$ is connected by a string over the pulley to the piano $M$, which is positioned on an inclined plane with an angle $\theta$ from the horizontal.
The mass $M$ experiences kinetic friction characterized by a coefficient $\mu_k$ with the inclined plane.
The piano $M$ is heavy enough that its sliding down the ramp and pulling the man $m$ up. 
Determine the acceleration $a$ of the system.

### Diagram {.unnumbered}
TODO: Create a diagram showing the two masses, $m$ and $M$, the inclined plane with angle $\theta$, and the direction of the frictional force opposing the motion of $M$ up the incline.

### Directions {.unnumbered}
TODO gravity points down

- Direction of $a$ for man is vertically upwards.
- Direction of $a$ for piano downward along the incline.

### Definitions & Data {.unnumbered}

- $m$: Mass hanging from the pulley (kg)
- $M$: Mass on the inclined plane (kg)
- $\theta$: Angle of the inclined plane from the horizontal (radians)
- $\mu_k$: Coefficient of kinetic friction
- $g$: Acceleration due to gravity

### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Consider the forces on each mass and draw a free body diagram:

TODO FBD 

- Mass $m$: Gravitational force $mg$ and tension $T$.
- Mass $M$: Gravitational force component along the incline, normal force, frictional force $f_k = \mu_k N$, and tension $T$.
- Conservation of String: string is the same length, so when pulled the forces are transmitted without diminishing.


### Derivation {.unnumbered}
1. Write down the force equations for each mass.
   - For mass $m$: $mg - T = ma$ (Downward force - tension = mass times acceleration).
   - For mass $M$: $Mg\sin(\theta) - f_k - T = Ma$ (Component of gravity along incline - friction - tension = mass times acceleration).

$$\left| F\right| = \left(m + M\right) * \left|a\right|$$

$$N = M g \cos{\theta}$$

$$T = T$$

$$ \therefore \sum{F} = M g \sin{\theta}  + \mu_k N - m g$$


### D'algebra {.unnumbered}

$$\left| F\right| = \left(m + M\right) * \left|a\right| = M g \sin{\theta}  + \mu_k N - m g$$


$$\begin{aligned}
\left| a\right| &= \frac{M g \sin{\theta}  + \mu_k N - m g}{\left(m + M\right)}\\
 &= \frac{M g \sin{\theta}  + \mu_k M g \cos{\theta} - m g}{\left(m + M\right)}
 \end{aligned}$$


### Determination {.unnumbered}

$$\boxed{\left| a\right|= g \left(\frac{M  \sin{\theta}  + \mu_k M  \cos{\theta} - m }{\left(m + M\right)}\right)}$$

### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

$$LHS = L T^{-2}$$

$$RHS = L T^{-2} \left(\frac{M + M - m}{M}\right)$$

Looks right!

### Limiting Cases {.unnumbered}
Consider extreme cases like:

- What happens when $\theta = 0$?
    - acceleration is difference in weight of the man from the frictional force. Makes sense.
- What happens when $\theta = 90^\circ$?
    - acceleration is the difference in masses divided by the sum of the masses times g. Makes sense.
- What happens when $\mu_k = 0$ or is very large?
    - Larger $\mu_k \implies$ smaller $a$.
- What happens if $M \gg m$?
    - The piano will slide as though nothing is attached (only forces of friction and force due to gravity matter). Makes sense.
- What happens if $m \gg M$?
    - The weight of the man will pull the piano up the incline. Makes sense.
