# Mechanics

## Energy, Conservation, and Forces

### Energy

Energy is the ability to do work — that which is conserved. It comes in two broad types:

- **Kinetic energy** — energy of motion: $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
- **Potential energy** — stored energy associated with position or configuration

Energy has units of $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2} = \text{J}$ (joules). It is a scalar.

There are many forms of potential energy, each associated with a fundamental force:

| Force | Potential Energy |
|-------|-----------------|
| Gravitational | $U = mgh$ (near surface), $U = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}$ (general) |
| Elastic (spring) | $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$ |
| Electrostatic | $U = \frac{kq_1q_2}{r}$ |
| Weak nuclear | (particle physics) |
| Strong nuclear | (particle physics) |

### Potential Energy Diagrams

A potential energy diagram plots $U(x)$ vs position $x$. Key features:

- **Equilibrium points** occur where $F = -\frac{dU}{dx} = 0$
- **Stable equilibrium**: local minimum (restoring force)
- **Unstable equilibrium**: local maximum
- A **potential well** traps particles with insufficient energy to escape
- The harmonic oscillator potential $U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$ is the simplest potential well; square wells also exist (quantum mechanics)

### Gravitational Potential Energy

By convention, $U = 0$ at $r \to \infty$. Since gravity is attractive, bringing masses closer *decreases* their potential energy, so:

$$\boxed{U = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}}$$

The force is related to the potential by:

$$F = -\frac{dU}{dr} = -\frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2}\,\hat{r}$$

The negative sign means the force points toward decreasing $r$ (attractive).

**Example: On the surface of the Earth.**

$$F = \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2} = \frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 6 \times 10^{24} \times 6 \times 10^1}{(6.4 \times 10^6)^2} \approx 588 \;\text{N}$$

**Change in gravitational PE** between two radii $r_1$ and $r_2$:

$$\Delta U = -\frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r_2} + \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r_1} = Gm_1 m_2\left(\frac{1}{r_1} - \frac{1}{r_2}\right)$$

### Force, Energy, and Work

Force is the derivative of potential energy:

$$F = -\frac{dU}{dx}$$

Conversely, potential energy is the negative integral of force:

$$dU = -F \cdot dx \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad U = -\int F \cdot dx \quad (\text{always})$$

**Work** is defined as the integral of force along a displacement:

$$W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{x}$$

*How much work does the Moon do sitting on the road due to the Earth?* Zero — no displacement, no work.

### Conservation of Energy

Energy is always conserved:

$$\Delta E = 0 \qquad E_i = E_f \quad \text{for an isolated system}$$

$$\Delta E_{\text{system}} + \Delta E_{\text{environment}} = 0$$

Conservation principles (like conservation of energy) are extremely powerful problem-solving tools.

**Example: Mass on a spring.** Consider a mass that can have gravitational PE, elastic PE, kinetic energy, bulk KE, and thermal energy:

## TODO: Diagram
Vertical mass-spring system showing the different energy types: gravitational PE at the top, elastic PE in the spring, and kinetic energy of the mass.
:::

### Hooke's Law and Spring Energy

The restoring force of a spring:

$$F_{\text{spring}} = -F_{\text{app}} = -k \Delta x$$

$$F = -kx$$

The work done compressing/stretching a spring (equivalently, the elastic PE stored):

$$W = \int_0^x F\,dx$$

$$\boxed{W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2}$$

### Mechanical Energy and Conservative Forces

A **conservative force** is one where only the endpoints matter — the work done is path-independent. For conservative forces, we can define a potential energy, and mechanical energy $E = U + K$ is conserved.

Gravitational and elastic forces are conservative. Electrostatic forces are also conservative.

**Non-conservative (dissipative) forces** convert mechanical energy into thermal and microscopic energy. Friction and air resistance are examples.

$$U = Mgh \qquad KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

When choosing a reference point for potential energy, you must be consistent — pick one and stick with it.

## Newton's Laws and Forces

### Potential vs. Potential Energy

An important distinction:

- **Potential energy** is an *extensive* property — depends on the specific object ($U_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r}$)
- **Potential** is an *intensive* property — depends only on the source ($V_{\text{grav}} = -\frac{Gm}{r}$)

Intensive units = extensive units / mass (or charge).

### Conservation Laws

Many quantities are conserved in isolated systems:

- Energy
- Momentum
- Angular momentum
- Mass
- Charge
- (and others: strangeness, baryon number, etc.)

### Newton's Laws

1. Every body has constant velocity unless acted upon by a non-zero net force (inertia).
2. $\vec{F} = m\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$
3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Force has units of $\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-2} = \text{N}$.

**Weight** $\neq$ mass. Weight is $mg$.

### Free Body Diagrams

Rules for drawing free body diagrams (FBDs):

- Draw a box or lump (depending on state)
- One body, simple, all forces on the same object on the diagram
- Use vector component forces — only forces acting on the object
- Only include *forces*, not velocities or accelerations
- Everything you experience (forces) except for gravity is electromagnetic in nature

**Example: Car going around a corner at constant speed.** What is the net force acting on the car, and what is its origin? The force is **centripetal**, directed toward the center of the turn, provided by friction between the tires and road.

### Normal Force

The normal (contact) force acts perpendicular to a surface. It is the surface's response to prevent objects from passing through.

- Usually equal to the weight component perpendicular to the surface
- It has a *maximum* value — the surface can be overwhelmed (e.g. breaking through)

**Example: Elevator.**

$$\sum F = ma$$

If the elevator accelerates upward at acceleration $a$:

$$N - mg = ma \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad N = m(g + a)$$

### Friction

**Static friction** acts parallel to the surface to prevent relative motion:

- Cold welding of microscopic surface bumps
- $F_s \leq \mu_s N$ (it adjusts up to a maximum)

**Kinetic friction** involves continuous formation and breakage of bonds:

- $F_k = \mu_k N$ (constant for a given pair of surfaces)
- This is an *approximation* (only a model)

**Example: Box on back of a ute (truck).**

Maximum acceleration before sliding:

$$F_{\max} = \mu_s N = \mu_s mg$$

$$a_{\max} = \mu_s g \quad (\text{independent of mass})$$

### Air Resistance

$$F_{\text{air}} = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_D A$$

At **terminal velocity**, the drag force equals the weight: $F_{\text{air}} = mg$.

### Tension

In an ideal rope:

- Force at one end is instantly transmitted without loss — every part feels the same tension
- $\theta_{\text{ideal rope}} = 0$ (massless, frictionless)
- Ideal ropes have no mass and are inextensible ($T = \text{const}$ throughout)
- Ideal pulleys act to change direction but nothing else
- $N \leq F_{\text{pull}}$: varies depending on applied force
- Two components of contact force (normal and friction) — minimum energy

### Momentum

$$\vec{p} = m\vec{v} \qquad \text{units: } \text{kg}\cdot\text{m}\cdot\text{s}^{-1} = \text{N}\cdot\text{s}$$

$$\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$

No force $\Rightarrow$ no change in momentum.

**Example:** Two carts, one mass $m$, the other mass $2m$, pushed by equal force for 3 seconds on an air track.

Equal momenta: $p_1 = p_2$

$$KE \propto \frac{p^2}{2m}$$

Since $p$ is the same, the lighter cart has more KE. It travels distance $2d$ while the heavier travels $d$.

### Newton's Third Law

Forces act on *different* objects:

$$\vec{F}_{AB} = -\vec{F}_{BA}$$

Gravity and normal force on the same object are **not** a Newton's third law pair — they have different origins.

$$\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = 0 \quad \text{if } F_{\text{AB}} = -F_{\text{BA}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{dp_A}{dt} = -\frac{dp_B}{dt}$$

Therefore, **momentum is always conserved** in an isolated system.

## Collisions

### Elastic Collisions

In elastic collisions, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved (gravity, conservative forces, Newton's cradle, gravitational slingshot).

Isolated system, two bodies:

$$\sum_i m_i v_i = C$$

$$m_A v_{Ai} + m_B v_{Bi} = m_A v_{Af} + m_B v_{Bf}$$

$$\frac{1}{2}m_A v_{Ai}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B v_{Bi}^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_A v_{Af}^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_B v_{Bf}^2$$

Solving these two equations simultaneously gives the final velocities:

$$\boxed{v_{Af} = \frac{m_A - m_B}{m_A + m_B}\,v_{Ai} + \frac{2m_B}{m_A + m_B}\,v_{Bi}}$$

$$\boxed{v_{Bf} = \frac{2m_A}{m_A + m_B}\,v_{Ai} + \frac{m_B - m_A}{m_A + m_B}\,v_{Bi}}$$

**Limiting cases:**

- If the masses are equal ($m_A = m_B$): they swap velocities
- If the masses are vastly different ($M \gg m$): $v_{Bf} \approx v_{Bi}$, the heavy object is barely affected
- If $B$ is initially at rest ($v_{Bi} = 0$) and $M \gg m$: $v_{Af} \approx -v_{Ai}$ (bounces back), $v_{Bf} \approx 0$

### Inelastic Collisions

In inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is lost (to deformation, heat, sound, etc.), but **momentum is still conserved**.

**Example: Rain falling into a moving sports car (coasting).**

As rain accumulates, the speed decreases. If you drill a hole to let the water out, the car does *not* speed back up — unless the water is pumped out stationary with respect to the road.

For a perfectly inelastic collision (objects stick together):

$$m_A v_{Ai} + m_B v_{Bi} = (m_A + m_B) v_f$$

$$\boxed{v_f = \frac{m_A v_{Ai} + m_B v_{Bi}}{m_A + m_B}}$$

## Rotational Mechanics

### Rotational Kinematics

A **rigid body** has every point moving in a circular path, with the centers of those circles on a common axis. It can be approximated as a single point for pure rotation.

**Variables:**

| Linear | Rotational | Relation |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| $x$ (displacement) | $\theta$ (angle, rad) | $s = r\theta$ |
| $v$ (velocity) | $\omega$ (angular velocity, rad/s) | $v = r\omega$ |
| $a$ (acceleration) | $\alpha$ (angular acceleration, rad/s$^2$) | $a = r\alpha$ |

: Linear vs. Rotational Quantities {.striped .hover}

Positive direction is arbitrary but must be defined (right-hand rule).

**Equations of motion** (identical in form to linear kinematics):

$$\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t$$

$$\theta = \theta_0 + \omega_0 t + \frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$$

$$\omega^2 = \omega_0^2 + 2\alpha\theta$$

Angular velocity direction given by the **right-hand rule**: curl fingers in the direction of rotation, thumb points along the axis.

### Torque

Torque is the rotational analogue of force. It depends on where and in what direction the force is applied:

$$\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$$

$$|\tau| = rF\sin\theta$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{r}$ and $\vec{F}$.

### Moment of Inertia

The moment of inertia $I$ is the rotational analogue of mass — it measures resistance to angular acceleration.

- Single particle: $I = mr^2$
- Collection of particles: $I = \sum_i m_i r_i^2$
- Solid body: $I = \iiint r^2 \, dm$

#### Parallel Axis Theorem

$$I = I_{cm} + Mh^2$$

where $h$ is the distance between the center-of-mass axis and the parallel axis.

#### Perpendicular Axis Theorem

For a thin, flat object (2D):

$$I_z = I_x + I_y$$

### Moment of Inertia of a Sphere

For a uniform solid sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$, using cylindrical polar coordinates:

$$I = \iiint r_\perp^2 \, dm = \rho \iiint r_\perp^2 \, dV$$

Carrying out the integration:

$$I = 2\pi\rho \int_0^R \left(\frac{(R^2 - z^2)^2}{4}\right) dz = \frac{8\pi\rho}{15} R^5$$

Since $M = \rho V = \rho \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$:

$$\boxed{I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2}$$

### Newton's Second Law for Rotation

$$\tau = I\alpha$$

This is the rotational analogue of $F = ma$.

### Example: Rolling Without Slipping {.unnumbered}

A ball of mass $M$ and radius $R$ rolls without slipping down an incline of angle $\theta$.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Ball rolling down an incline. Show forces: weight $Mg$ at center (downward), normal force $N$ perpendicular to surface, friction $f$ at contact point (up the incline). Coordinate axes: $x$ along incline (positive downhill), $y$ perpendicular to incline.
:::

**Rolling constraint:** $v = R\omega$, so $a = R\alpha$.

**Translational** (along the incline):

$$Mg\sin\theta - f = Ma$$

**Rotational** (about center of mass):

$$fR = I\alpha = I\frac{a}{R}$$

$$f = \frac{Ia}{R^2}$$

Substituting:

$$Mg\sin\theta - \frac{Ia}{R^2} = Ma$$

$$a = \frac{Mg\sin\theta}{M + I/R^2} = \frac{g\sin\theta}{1 + I/(MR^2)}$$

For a solid sphere with $I = \frac{2}{5}MR^2$:

$$\boxed{a = \frac{5}{7}g\sin\theta}$$

Objects with smaller $I/(MR^2)$ roll faster. A sliding frictionless block ($I = 0$) has $a = g\sin\theta$, the maximum.

### Rotational Kinetic Energy

For pure rotation:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$$

For combined rotation and translation:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2 + \frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2$$

Rotational work:

$$W = \int \tau \, d\theta$$

**Comparison of rolling objects down a ramp.** The total kinetic energy is $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2(1 + k)$ where $k = I/(mR^2)$:

| Object | $I$ | $k = I/(mR^2)$ |
|--------|-----|-----------------|
| Solid sphere | $\frac{2}{5}MR^2$ | $2/5$ |
| Solid cylinder | $\frac{1}{2}MR^2$ | $1/2$ |
| Hoop | $MR^2$ | $1$ |

: Moments of Inertia for Rolling Objects {.striped .hover}

The lower $k$, the higher the translational speed — the **sphere is fastest**.

### Angular Momentum

Angular momentum is the rotational analogue of linear momentum:

$$\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{p}$$

For a rigid body with axial symmetry:

$$L = I\omega$$

**Angular momentum and torque:**

$$\vec{\tau} = \frac{d\vec{L}}{dt}$$

This can be broken into components: $\sum \tau_x = \frac{dL_x}{dt}$, etc.

**Steiner's theorem** (parallel axis for angular momentum):

$$L = L_{cm} + MR_{cm} \times v_{cm}$$

### Conservation of Angular Momentum

If $\tau_{\text{ext}} = 0$, then $\frac{dL}{dt} = 0$, so $L = \text{const}$.

$$I_i\omega_i = I_f\omega_f$$

**Example: Girl on a merry-go-round.** A girl of mass $m$ walks from the rim (radius $R$) toward the center of a merry-go-round (moment of inertia $I_0$, initial angular velocity $\omega_0$).

At the rim: $L = (I_0 + mR^2)\omega_0$

At radius $r$: $L = (I_0 + mr^2)\omega$

$$\omega = \frac{(I_0 + mR^2)\omega_0}{I_0 + mr^2}$$

As $r \to 0$: $\omega$ increases (she spins faster as she moves inward).

Angular momentum does **not** imply circular motion — objects moving in a straight line have angular momentum relative to any external point.

### Precession

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Spinning top with gravity pulling down at center of mass. Show the torque $\tau = rmg\sin\theta$ causing the angular momentum vector $\vec{L}$ to precess around the vertical axis. Include: the precession circle traced by the tip of $\vec{L}$, the angle $\theta$ from vertical, and the precession angular velocity $\omega_p$.
:::

Precession is caused by a small lateral torque that changes the *direction* of the angular momentum vector without affecting its magnitude.

For a spinning top tilted at angle $\theta$ from vertical:

- Torque: $\tau = rmg\sin\theta$
- The torque causes $\vec{L}$ to rotate horizontally: $dL = L\sin\theta \, d\phi$

$$\omega_p = \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$

Since $\tau\,dt = dL = L\sin\theta\,d\phi$:

$$\omega_p\,dt = \frac{dL}{L\sin\theta} = \frac{\tau\,dt}{L\sin\theta}$$

$$\boxed{\omega_p = \frac{rmg}{L} = \frac{rmg}{I\omega}}$$

The precession rate is inversely proportional to $L$ (the speed of the top) — a slower top precesses in wider, faster circles.

## Gravity and Orbits

### Newton's Law of Gravitation

Gravity is an attractive force between any two masses:

$$\vec{F} = -\frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2}\,\hat{r}$$

**Shell theorem:** For multiple masses, use vector superposition (or potentials). Spherically symmetric objects behave exactly like point masses (when you are outside them).

### Gravitational Field

The gravitational field is the force per unit mass — an *intensive*, vector field:

$$\vec{g} = -\frac{GM}{r^2}\,\hat{r}$$

**Field lines:**

- Show direction of force at a point in space
- Emanate from masses
- Never cross around sharp edges
- Density of field lines gives relative field strength

**Flux** is the measure of field lines passing through a surface:

$$\Phi_{\text{grav}} = \oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A}$$

### Gauss's Law for Gravity

The net flux through a closed surface depends only on the enclosed mass:

$$\boxed{\oint \vec{g} \cdot d\vec{A} = -4\pi G M_{\text{enclosed}}}$$

Use this (with a good choice of Gaussian surface) when there is symmetry.

### Gravitational Field Inside and Outside a Sphere

**Outside the Earth** (or any spherically symmetric body):

$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$

Identical to a point mass at the center.

**Inside a hollow shell:**

$$g = 0$$

Apply Gauss's law: the enclosed mass is zero, so the field inside a uniform shell vanishes. This is a remarkable result.

**Inside a uniform solid sphere** (at radius $r < R$):

The enclosed mass is $M_{\text{enc}} = M\frac{r^3}{R^3}$ (assuming uniform density), so:

$$g = \frac{GM_{\text{enc}}}{r^2} = \frac{GM}{R^3}\,r$$

The field increases linearly with $r$ inside the sphere.

### Gravitational Potential Energy (General)

Potential energy is extensive (depends on both masses). Define $U = 0$ at $r \to \infty$:

$$U = -\int_\infty^r \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{r} = -\int_\infty^r \frac{GMm}{r^2}\,dr$$

$$\boxed{U = -\frac{GMm}{r}}$$

### Gravitational Potential

Potential is the potential energy per unit mass — an *intensive* scalar:

$$V = \frac{U}{m} = -\frac{GM}{r}$$

| Property | Extensive | Intensive |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Energy | $E$ (J) | — |
| Gravitational | $U$ (J) | $V$ (J/kg) |
| Electrostatic | $U$ (J) | $V$ (V) |

: Extensive vs. Intensive Quantities {.striped .hover}

### Equipotentials

- Lines or surfaces of equal potential
- Perpendicular to field lines (e.g., perpendicular to gravity)
- In a conservative field, journeys that start and end on the same equipotential require no net energy

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Equipotential lines around a point mass, showing concentric circles with field lines (arrows) pointing radially inward, perpendicular to the equipotentials. Include a hilly landscape analogy showing contour lines.
:::

### Escape Velocity

The velocity needed to escape a gravitational field entirely (reach $r \to \infty$ with $v = 0$). By conservation of energy:

$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{\text{esc}}^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = 0$$

$$\boxed{v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}}$$

### Kepler's Laws

1. All planets move in **elliptical orbits** with the Sun at one focus.
2. A line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps out **equal areas in equal times** (conservation of angular momentum).
3. The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

$$T^2 \propto a^3$$

**Proof of Kepler's Third Law** (for circular orbits):

For a circular orbit, gravitational force provides centripetal acceleration:

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} = mr\omega^2$$

$$\omega^2 = \frac{GM}{r^3} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{4\pi^2}{T^2} = \frac{GM}{r^3}$$

$$\boxed{\frac{T^2}{r^3} = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}}$$

## Fluids

### Pressure

Fluids are things that flow. We describe them using **pressure** and **volume** instead of mass and force.

$$P = \frac{F}{A}$$

Units: $\text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^{-1}\cdot\text{s}^{-2} = \text{Pa}$ (pascals). Also: $1\;\text{atm} = 760\;\text{mmHg} = 14.7\;\text{PSI} = 1.01 \times 10^5\;\text{Pa}$.

Pressure is a **scalar** — it has no direction (it acts equally in all directions at a point in a fluid).

**Gauge pressure** vs. **absolute pressure:**

- Gauge pressure is measured relative to atmospheric pressure
- Absolute = gauge + atmospheric
- Example: blood pressure of 120 mmHg is *gauge*; tire pressure of 12 kPa is *gauge*; barometric pressure of 102 kPa is *absolute*

### Hydrostatic Pressure

The pressure due to a static fluid column, from the weight of fluid above:

$$F = W = mg = \rho V g = \rho A h g$$

$$P = \frac{F}{A} = \rho g h$$

$$\boxed{P = \rho g h + P_0}$$

where $P_0$ is the pressure at the top of the fluid (e.g. atmospheric pressure).

**Key insight:** Pressure depends only on *depth*, not on the shape of the container.

**Example: Designing a dam.** For a wall of width $w$ and depth $h$, the pressure at depth $d$ is $P = \rho g d$. The total force requires integrating over the wall area.

### Archimedes' Principle

A submerged object displaces its own volume of fluid. This allows volume estimation of irregular objects (and fat content of people).

**Buoyancy:** A body fully or partially submerged is buoyed up by a force equal to the *weight of the fluid it displaces*. Air also exerts a buoyancy force.

$$F_{\text{buoy}} = \rho_{\text{fluid}} V_{\text{displaced}} \, g$$

For a floating object: $F_{\text{buoy}} = W$, so:

$$\rho_{\text{fluid}} V_{\text{displaced}} g = mg$$

**Conditions:**

- $\rho_{\text{object}} > \rho_{\text{fluid}}$: sinks ($W > F_b$)
- $\rho_{\text{object}} < \rho_{\text{fluid}}$: floats ($F_b > W$, partially submerged)
- $\rho_{\text{object}} = \rho_{\text{fluid}}$: neutral buoyancy (total submersion)

For a partially submerged object: $F_b = W$, so $\rho_{\text{fluid}} V_{\text{displaced}} g = m_{\text{object}} g$, or equivalently $V_{\text{displaced}}/V_{\text{object}} = \rho_{\text{object}}/\rho_{\text{fluid}}$.

**Example: Ice cubes.** Two identical glasses of water, one with an ice cube, one without. Do they have the same water level? Yes — the ice displaces exactly its own weight in water. When it melts, $W_{\text{ice}} = W_{\text{displaced water}}$, so the level stays the same.

### Buoyancy Example: Helium Airship {.unnumbered}

What volume of He is needed to lift a 1000 kg airship?

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Airship (blimp shape) with volume $V_H$ of helium, payload mass $M$. Show forces: buoyancy $F_b = \rho_a V_H g$ upward, weight $Mg + \rho_H V_H g$ downward.
:::

At equilibrium ($\sum F = 0$):

$$\rho_a V_H g - Mg - \rho_H V_H g = 0$$

$$V_H(\rho_a - \rho_H) = M$$

$$V_H = \frac{M}{\rho_a - \rho_H}$$

### Real vs. Ideal Fluids

| Ideal Fluid | Real Fluid |
|-------------|------------|
| Non-viscous (no internal friction) | Viscous |
| Incompressible (density is constant) | May be compressible |
| Laminar, non-rotational flow | Can become turbulent |

: {.striped .hover}

Viscous fluids slow down — important in fuel, oil, blood flow. Viscosity usually decreases with increasing temperature (engine oil gets runnier when warm).

### Continuity Equation

For an incompressible fluid, what goes in must come out. The **volume flow rate** is constant:

$$Q = Av = \text{constant} \qquad \text{units: } \text{m}^3\text{s}^{-1}$$

$$\boxed{A_1 v_1 = A_2 v_2}$$

If the pipe narrows, the fluid speeds up.

### Bernoulli's Equation

Once a flow is established, two conservation principles apply:

- **Continuity**: conservation of mass (volume flow rate is constant)
- **Bernoulli's equation**: conservation of energy (energy density is constant)

$$\boxed{P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h = \text{constant}}$$

This is conservation of energy density along a streamline:

- $P$: pressure energy (electrostatic analogy)
- $\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$: kinetic energy density
- $\rho g h$: gravitational potential energy density

**Note:** The pressure in Bernoulli's equation is the pressure the walls of the pipe exert on the fluid. This is *not* conservation of momentum (a common misconception).

**Example: Water flowing through a pipe.** At a constriction, $v$ increases (continuity), so $P$ must decrease (Bernoulli). This is a pressure drop: $\Delta P = -\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2$.

### Bernoulli Applications

**Venturi effect:** Where fluid speeds up, pressure drops. This explains:

- Lift on an aerofoil (faster flow over top → lower pressure → net upward force)
- Roofs blowing off in storms (fast wind over roof, still air underneath)
- Aeroplane lift: $F_{\text{lift}} \approx \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 A$

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Aerofoil cross-section showing streamlines compressed above (faster, lower pressure) and wider below (slower, higher pressure). Include net upward force arrow.
:::

Open windows on the lee side to equalize pressure (how aeroplanes fly, how roofs stay on).

Bernoulli's equation can only be applied along a continuous streamline.

### Poiseuille's Law

For viscous flow through a pipe of radius $r$ and length $\Delta L$, the volume flow rate is:

$$\boxed{Q = \frac{\pi r^4}{8\eta} \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta L}}$$

where $\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity. Note the extremely strong $r^4$ dependence — doubling the radius increases flow by a factor of 16.

**Flow vs. flux:** Flow ($Q$) is volume per time; flux is flow per unit area.

## Practice Problems

#### Directions {.unnumbered}

Define positive as $m_1$ moving downward (and $m_2$ moving upward), since $m_1 > m_2$.

#### Definitions & Given Data {.unnumbered}

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $m_1$ | Heavier mass (kg) |
| $m_2$ | Lighter mass (kg) |
| $g$ | Gravitational acceleration (m/s$^2$) |
| $T$ | Tension in the string (N) |
| $a$ | Acceleration of the system (m/s$^2$) |

#### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

This is a constrained two-body Newton's second law problem. Both masses share the same magnitude of acceleration (inextensible string) and the same tension (massless string over ideal pulley). Apply $F = ma$ to each mass separately.

#### Derivation {.unnumbered}

For mass $m_1$ (positive direction = downward):

$$m_1 g - T = m_1 a \tag{1}$$

For mass $m_2$ (positive direction = upward):

$$T - m_2 g = m_2 a \tag{2}$$

Two equations, two unknowns ($a$ and $T$).

#### Determination {.unnumbered}

Add equations (1) and (2) to eliminate $T$:

$$m_1 g - m_2 g = (m_1 + m_2) a$$

$$\boxed{a = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\,g}$$

Substitute back into equation (2) to find $T$:

$$T = m_2(g + a) = m_2 g\left(1 + \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\right) = m_2 g \cdot \frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2}$$

$$\boxed{T = \frac{2m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\,g}$$

#### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

- $[a] = \frac{[\text{kg}]}{[\text{kg}]} \cdot [\text{m/s}^2] = [\text{m/s}^2]$ ✓
- $[T] = \frac{[\text{kg}]^2}{[\text{kg}]} \cdot [\text{m/s}^2] = [\text{N}]$ ✓
- If $m_1 = m_2$: $a = 0$ and $T = mg$ — balanced, no acceleration ✓
- If $m_2 = 0$: $a = g$ — free fall ✓
- $T = \frac{2m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}g$ is always between $m_2 g$ and $m_1 g$ — the string must support less than the heavier weight but more than the lighter ✓

#### Diagram {.unnumbered}

See placeholder above.

#### Directions {.unnumbered}

Radial direction: inward positive (toward Earth's center). Tangential direction: along the velocity.

#### Definitions & Given Data {.unnumbered}

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $M$ | Mass of Earth (kg) |
| $R$ | Radius of Earth (m) |
| $h$ | Height above surface (m) |
| $r = R + h$ | Orbital radius (m) |
| $G$ | Gravitational constant |
| $v$ | Orbital speed (m/s) |
| $T$ | Orbital period (s) |

#### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Uniform circular motion: gravity provides the centripetal force. One equation, one unknown ($v$). The period follows from $T = 2\pi r / v$.

#### Derivation {.unnumbered}

Gravitational force equals centripetal force:

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$

The satellite mass $m$ cancels.

#### Determination {.unnumbered}

$$v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$

$$\boxed{v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R+h}}}$$

For the period:

$$T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = 2\pi r \sqrt{\frac{r}{GM}} = \frac{2\pi r^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}$$

$$\boxed{T = \frac{2\pi (R+h)^{3/2}}{\sqrt{GM}}}$$

#### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

- $[v] = \sqrt{\frac{[\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-2}\text{kg}^{-1}][\text{kg}]}{[\text{m}]}} = [\text{m/s}]$ ✓
- $[T] = \frac{[\text{m}]^{3/2}}{[\text{m}^{3/2}\text{s}^{-1}]} = [\text{s}]$ ✓
- As $h \to 0$: $v \to \sqrt{GM/R}$ — maximum orbital speed at the surface ✓
- As $h \to \infty$: $v \to 0$, $T \to \infty$ — distant orbits are slow ✓

#### Substitution {.unnumbered}

For low Earth orbit ($h \approx 400\;\text{km}$, $R = 6.4 \times 10^6\;\text{m}$, $GM = 4 \times 10^{14}\;\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-2}$):

$$v \approx \sqrt{\frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{6.8 \times 10^6}} \approx 7.7\;\text{km/s}$$

$$T \approx \frac{2\pi \times 6.8 \times 10^6}{7700} \approx 5500\;\text{s} \approx 92\;\text{min}$$
