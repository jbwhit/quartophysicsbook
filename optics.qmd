# Optics

## Geometrical Optics

### The Ray Model of Light

When light encounters obstacles or apertures much larger than its wavelength, we can ignore wave effects (interference, diffraction) and treat light as traveling in straight lines called **rays**. This is the **ray model** — the foundation of geometrical optics.

At a boundary between two media, a ray can be:

- **Reflected** — bounced back into the same medium
- **Refracted** (transmitted) — bent as it passes into the new medium

### Reflection

The **law of reflection**: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal to the surface:

$$\boxed{\theta_i = \theta_r}$$

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram

:::

Phase change upon reflection depends on the relative wave speeds:

- If $v_1 < v_2$ (going from slower to faster medium): reflected wave undergoes a phase change of $\pi$ (inverted)
- If $v_1 > v_2$ (going from faster to slower medium): no phase change

### Refraction and Snell's Law

When light crosses a boundary between two media, its speed changes. The **refractive index** $n$ of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in the medium:

$$n = \frac{v_\text{vacuum}}{v}$$

Since frequency is set by the source and does not change across a boundary, only the wavelength and speed change.

Using Fermat's principle (light takes the path of minimum time) or geometry, we derive **Snell's law**:

$$\boxed{n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2 \sin\theta_2}$$

where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles from the normal in media 1 and 2, respectively.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram

:::

### Total Internal Reflection

When light travels from a denser medium ($n_1 > n_2$) to a less dense one, there is a **critical angle** $\theta_c$ beyond which all light is reflected — no transmission occurs:

$$\sin\theta_c = \frac{n_2}{n_1} \quad \text{(only for } n_1 > n_2\text{)}$$

$$\boxed{\theta_c = \arcsin\!\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)}$$

At $\theta_1 = \theta_c$, the refracted ray travels along the surface ($\theta_2 = 90°$). For $\theta_1 > \theta_c$, total internal reflection occurs. This is the principle behind **optical fibers** — light bounces along the core by repeated total internal reflection.

### Fermat's Principle

> A light ray traveling from one point to another follows a path such that the time required is a minimum (or maximum) compared to other paths.

Mathematically: $dt/dx = 0$ along the ray path. Fermat's principle can be used to derive both the law of reflection and Snell's law.

## Image Formation

Geometrical optics deals with the formation of images using reflection (mirrors) and refraction (lenses). We can understand optical instruments using **ray tracing**.

### Objects and Images

- **Objects** — things that emit or reflect light (the source)
- **Images** — what you see (light on the back of your retina)
  - **Real image** — light actually converges there; can be projected on a screen
  - **Virtual image** — light appears to diverge from there, but doesn't actually pass through; cannot be projected
- **Magnification** — ratio of image size to object size; can be $> 1$ or $< 1$

### Plane Mirrors

A plane mirror produces a virtual image that is:

- The same size as the object ($|M| = 1$)
- The same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front
- Laterally inverted (left–right reversal)

The minimum mirror length needed to see your full body is **half your height** — the mirror only needs to span from halfway between your eyes and the top of your head to halfway between your eyes and your feet.

**Multiple mirrors:**

- Two mirrors at right angles produce 3 images
- Two parallel mirrors produce infinitely many images (fading with distance)

## Curved Mirrors

### Concave Mirrors

A concave (converging) mirror has a focal length related to its radius of curvature:

$$f = \frac{R}{2}$$

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Concave mirror showing center of curvature $C$, focal point $F$, and principal axis. Show how parallel rays converge at $F$.
:::

**Ray diagrams** — three special rays from the top of the object:

1. **Parallel ray** — reflects through the focal point
2. **Focal ray** — passes through $F$, reflects back parallel to the axis
3. **Radial ray** — travels through the center of curvature $C$, reflects back on itself

Any two of these rays locate the image.

**Three cases for a concave mirror:**

1. Object beyond $C$ — image is real, inverted, reduced
2. Object between $C$ and $F$ — image is real, inverted, magnified
3. Object inside $F$ — image is virtual, upright, magnified

### The Mirror Equation

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f}}$$

where $s$ is the object distance, $s'$ is the image distance, and $f$ is the focal length.

**Sign conventions:**

- For a concave mirror, $f$ is positive
- For a convex mirror, $f$ is negative
- If $s' > 0$, the image is on the same side as the object (real)
- If $s' < 0$, the image is on the opposite side (virtual)

### Magnification

$$\boxed{M = -\frac{s'}{s}}$$

- $M > 0$: image is upright
- $M < 0$: image is inverted
- $|M| > 1$: image is magnified
- $|M| < 1$: image is reduced

### Convex Mirrors

A convex (diverging) mirror always produces a virtual, upright, reduced image. The focal point is behind the mirror ($f < 0$).

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram

:::

## Thin Lenses

### Refraction at Curved Surfaces

When light refracts through a curved surface, the sign conventions are:

- $s$ is positive on the incident (incoming) side
- $s'$ is positive on the transmission side
- $R$ is positive for a convex surface, negative for concave

### The Lensmaker's Equation

For a thin lens with refractive index $n$ in air, with radii of curvature $R_1$ and $R_2$:

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{f} = (n-1)\!\left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)}$$

The **diopter** $D = 1/f$ (in m$^{-1}$) measures the optical power of a lens.

- **Converging lens** (double convex): $f > 0$ — brings parallel rays to a focus
- **Diverging lens** (double concave): $f < 0$ — spreads parallel rays apart

### The Thin Lens Equation

The same equation as for mirrors:

$$\frac{1}{s} + \frac{1}{s'} = \frac{1}{f}$$

with magnification $M = -s'/s$.

### Ray Tracing for Lenses

Three special rays from the top of the object:

1. **Parallel ray** — refracts through the focal point on the far side
2. **Focal ray** — passes through $F$ on the near side, refracts parallel to the axis
3. **Central ray** — passes straight through the center of the lens (undeviated, because the surfaces are locally parallel)

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram

:::

### The Eye and Vision

The eye is a lens system that focuses images on the retina. The ciliary muscles adjust the lens curvature to focus at different distances (**accommodation**).

- **Short-sighted** (myopia) — eye too long or lens too strong; corrected with a diverging lens
- **Long-sighted** (hyperopia) — eye too short or lens too weak; corrected with a converging lens

People naturally become long-sighted with age as the lens stiffens.

### Optical Instruments

**Combination of lenses:** line up images in cascade — the image of the first lens becomes the object of the second.

**Refracting telescope:** two converging lenses separated by $L = f_1 + f_2$ (matching focal points). The angular magnification is:

$$m = \frac{f_1}{f_2}$$

where $f_1$ is the objective focal length and $f_2$ is the eyepiece focal length. For high magnification, use a long-focal-length objective and a short-focal-length eyepiece.

**Reflecting telescope:** uses a concave mirror instead of an objective lens. Advantages:

- No **chromatic aberration** (different wavelengths refract at different angles through a lens, but all reflect identically from a mirror)
- Mirrors can be made larger and are structurally stronger

## Physical Optics: Interference

When the size of obstacles or apertures is comparable to the wavelength of light, we must account for the wave nature of light. This is **physical optics**.

### Light as an Electromagnetic Wave

Light is a transverse wave of coupled electric and magnetic fields. In vacuum:

$$v = c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0}}$$

The $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ fields are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation. As with all waves, the traveling wave solution is:

$$E(x,t) = E_0 \sin(kx - \omega t)$$

The **intensity** (time-averaged power per unit area) is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude:

$$I = \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0 c E_0^2$$

Note the factor of $1/2$ from time-averaging. What we actually see (and what detectors measure) is the intensity, not the field.

### Huygens' Construction

Every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The envelope of these wavelets at a later time gives the new wavefront.

This principle explains:

- **Diffraction** — bending of waves around obstacles and through apertures
- **Refraction** — change in direction when wavelet speeds change at a boundary

### Coherence

For interference to be observable, the light sources must be **coherent** — they must maintain a constant phase relationship $\delta(t)$ over time. Lasers are coherent; incandescent bulbs are not.

### Superposition and Interference

When two coherent waves overlap:

$$y(x,t) = y_1(x,t) + y_2(x,t)$$

Any waveform can be built up from a set of simple sinusoidal waves (**Fourier analysis**). For two waves of the same amplitude and frequency but with a phase difference $\phi$:

$$y = 2A\cos\!\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)\sin\!\left(kx - \omega t + \frac{\phi}{2}\right)$$

- $\phi = 0$: **constructive interference** — amplitude doubles
- $\phi = \pi$: **destructive interference** — amplitude is zero
- Intermediate $\phi$: something in between

### Phasors

A **phasor** is a rotating vector of length $E_0$ that rotates at frequency $\omega$. The projection onto one axis gives the instantaneous field:

$$E(t) = E_0 \sin(\omega t)$$

To add two waves, **add their phasors as vectors**. The resultant phasor gives the amplitude and phase of the combined wave. This is far easier than trigonometric manipulation, especially for many waves.

### The Double Slit

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Double slit setup: monochromatic light incident on two slits separated by $d$. Show path difference $d\sin\theta$ to a point P on a distant screen at angle $\theta$.
:::

Two narrow slits separated by distance $d$, illuminated by coherent monochromatic light. The **path difference** to a distant point at angle $\theta$ is:

$$\Delta = d\sin\theta$$

- **Constructive interference** (bright fringes): $d\sin\theta = m\lambda$, where $m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$
- **Destructive interference** (dark fringes): $d\sin\theta = (m + \tfrac{1}{2})\lambda$

Using phasors, the phase difference between the two waves is:

$$\phi = \frac{2\pi d\sin\theta}{\lambda}$$

Adding two phasors of equal amplitude $E_0$ at angle $\phi$ using the cosine rule gives a resultant amplitude $E_R = 2E_0\cos(\phi/2)$. Since intensity goes as amplitude squared:

$$\boxed{I = 4I_0 \cos^2\!\left(\frac{\pi d\sin\theta}{\lambda}\right)}$$

where $I_0$ is the intensity from a single slit.

### Diffraction Gratings

A **diffraction grating** is a large number $N$ of closely spaced slits (typically hundreds or thousands per mm). The maxima occur at the same positions as the double slit:

$$d\sin\theta = m\lambda, \qquad m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$$

But with $N$ slits, the peaks become much **sharper**. The angular half-width of each peak is:

$$\boxed{\delta\theta = \frac{\lambda}{Nd\cos\theta}}$$

More slits means sharper peaks and better wavelength resolution.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Intensity patterns for $N = 2$, $3$, and many slits. Show how peaks narrow and secondary maxima appear as $N$ increases. Include phasor polygons for each case.
:::

**Phasor picture:** For $N$ slits, the phasors form a polygon. At the first minimum, the phasors close into a regular polygon — the total phase accumulated is $2\pi$, giving $\phi_\text{min} = 2\pi/N$ per slit.

### Spectrometers and Dispersion

A diffraction grating acts as a **spectrometer** — it separates light by wavelength. The angular separation of different wavelengths is characterized by the **dispersion**:

$$\boxed{D = \frac{d\theta}{d\lambda} = \frac{m}{d\cos\theta}}$$

where $m$ is the diffraction order. Note that dispersion does not depend on $N$ — more slits make the peaks sharper, but don't move them.

The **resolving power** of a grating is its ability to distinguish two closely spaced wavelengths:

$$\boxed{R = \frac{\lambda}{\Delta\lambda} = Nm}$$

where $N$ is the number of slits and $m$ is the order. To resolve finer wavelength differences, use more slits or work at higher order.

### Thin Film Interference

When light reflects from a thin film (e.g., a soap bubble or oil slick), interference occurs between rays reflected from the top and bottom surfaces.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Thin film of thickness $t$ and refractive index $n_2$ between media $n_1$ and $n_3$. Show the two reflected rays and the path difference.
:::

Key considerations:

- A ray reflecting from a boundary going to a higher $n$ gets a phase change of $\pi$ (equivalent to adding $\lambda/2$ to the path)
- A ray reflecting from a boundary going to a lower $n$ has no phase change
- The path difference through the film is $2t$ (multiplied by $n_2$ for the optical path)

For a film of refractive index $n$ and thickness $t$:

- If only one surface gives a phase change: constructive interference when $2nt = m\lambda$
- If both or neither surfaces give a phase change: constructive interference when $2nt = (m + \tfrac{1}{2})\lambda$

**Anti-reflection coatings:** Choose $n$ and $t$ so that the reflected rays interfere destructively. For a quarter-wave coating ($t = \lambda/(4n)$), reflected light is suppressed.

### The Michelson Interferometer

A **beam splitter** divides a beam into two paths. Each beam reflects from a mirror and returns. The recombined beams interfere, and the pattern depends on the path difference $d_2 - d_1$.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Michelson interferometer: source, beam splitter at 45°, two mirrors at right angles, and detector. Show the two beam paths.
:::

Moving one mirror by $\lambda/2$ shifts the pattern by one fringe. This allows extremely precise distance measurements — down to fractions of a wavelength.

## Diffraction

Diffraction occurs when waves encounter obstacles or apertures comparable in size to their wavelength. While interference deals with a finite number of discrete sources, diffraction treats a continuous distribution.

### Huygens' Principle and X-Ray Diffraction

Huygens' principle: every point on a wavefront is a source of secondary wavelets. For a large object, the shadow behind it is sharp. For a small object (comparable to $\lambda$), waves spread out — diffraction is significant.

**X-ray diffraction** uses short-wavelength radiation ($\lambda \sim 0.1$ nm) to probe crystal structure. **Bragg's law** gives the condition for constructive interference from crystal planes separated by spacing $d$:

$$\boxed{m\lambda = 2d\sin\theta}$$

where $\theta$ is measured from the crystal planes (not the normal). This can determine crystal structure and atomic spacing.

### Single Slit Diffraction

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Single slit of width $D$ with Fraunhofer diffraction. Show incoming plane wave, the slit, and the diffraction pattern on a distant screen. Label the central maximum and first minima.
:::

For a single slit of width $D$, **Fraunhofer diffraction** (far-field, $L \gg D$) gives minima at:

$$\boxed{D\sin\theta = m\lambda, \qquad m = \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots}$$

Note: $m = 0$ is the central maximum, not a minimum.

**Phase difference** between rays from opposite edges of the slit:

$$\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi D \sin\theta}{\lambda}$$

### Single Slit Intensity

Using the phasor approach: divide the slit into infinitely many point sources. At $\theta = 0$, all phasors line up (maximum intensity). At the first minimum, the phasors curl into a complete circle (net amplitude zero). At the second minimum, they form two complete circles.

For an arbitrary angle, the phasor integration gives the intensity:

$$\boxed{I = I_m \left[\frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\alpha}\right]^2, \qquad \alpha = \frac{\pi D \sin\theta}{\lambda}}$$

where $I_m$ is the intensity at the central maximum. The function $\operatorname{sinc}^2(\alpha) = [\sin(\alpha)/\alpha]^2$ has:

- Central maximum at $\alpha = 0$ (using L'Hôpital: $\sin\alpha/\alpha \to 1$)
- Zeros at $\alpha = m\pi$, i.e., $D\sin\theta = m\lambda$
- Secondary maxima that are much weaker than the central peak

### Combined Double Slit and Diffraction

In reality, each slit has a finite width $D$, so the double-slit pattern is **modulated** by the single-slit diffraction envelope:

$$I = I_m \left[\frac{\sin\alpha}{\alpha}\right]^2 \cos^2\!\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right)$$

where $\alpha = \pi D\sin\theta/\lambda$ (single-slit envelope) and $\phi = 2\pi d\sin\theta/\lambda$ (double-slit interference).

### Circular Aperture: The Airy Disk

Telescopes and microscopes have circular apertures, so diffraction produces a circular pattern called the **Airy disk** instead of the linear pattern from a slit.

The first minimum of the Airy disk occurs at:

$$\boxed{\sin\theta = 1.22\frac{\lambda}{d}}$$

where $d$ is the diameter of the aperture. The factor 1.22 (compared to 1.00 for a slit) comes from the geometry of the circular aperture (Bessel functions).

### The Rayleigh Criterion

Two point sources are just **resolved** when the central maximum of one falls on the first minimum of the other. This gives the minimum angular separation:

$$\theta_R \approx 1.22\frac{\lambda}{d}$$

For **telescopes**: increase $d$ (larger aperture) to resolve finer details. For **microscopes**: use a smaller $\lambda$ (e.g., electron microscopes, where the de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than visible light).

## Polarization

### What Is Polarization?

Light is a transverse wave — the electric field oscillates perpendicular to the direction of propagation. **Polarization** describes the direction of this oscillation.

Most light sources (sun, incandescent bulbs) are **unpolarized** — the electric field direction varies randomly. Waves from a single antenna or laser, however, are **polarized** (the field oscillates in a preferred direction).

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Unpolarized light (random field directions) vs linearly polarized light (field oscillates in one plane). Show the propagation direction and field vectors.
:::

Methods of producing polarized light:

1. **Absorption** (Polaroid sheets)
2. **Reflection** (Brewster's angle)
3. **Scattering** (sunlight)
4. **Birefringence** (double refraction in crystals)

### Polarization by Absorption

A **Polaroid sheet** contains long-chain molecules that absorb the component of the electric field parallel to the chains, transmitting only the component perpendicular to them (the **transmission axis**).

For **unpolarized** light incident on a single polarizer, the transmitted intensity is:

$$I = \frac{I_0}{2}$$

because on average, half the intensity is in each polarization direction.

### Malus's Law

For **already polarized** light passing through a second polarizer (analyzer) at angle $\theta$ to the polarization direction:

$$\boxed{I = I_0 \cos^2\theta}$$

This is **Malus's law**. When the polarizers are parallel ($\theta = 0$), all light passes. When crossed ($\theta = 90°$), no light passes.

**Three polarizers:** Surprisingly, inserting a third polarizer between two crossed polarizers at an intermediate angle can transmit some light. For example, with the middle polarizer at $45°$:

$$I = I_0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \cos^2 45° \cdot \cos^2 45° = \frac{I_0}{8}$$

### Polarization by Reflection: Brewster's Angle

When unpolarized light reflects from a surface, the reflected light is partially polarized. At a special angle called **Brewster's angle**, the reflected light is **completely polarized** (perpendicular to the plane of incidence):

$$\boxed{\theta_B = \arctan\!\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)}$$

At Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular ($\theta_1 + \theta_2 = 90°$).

Practical application: polarized sunglasses block horizontally polarized glare from reflective surfaces (roads, water) because reflected light is preferentially polarized in the horizontal plane.

### Polarization by Scattering

When light scatters off air molecules, the scattered light is partially polarized. The electric field of the incoming wave causes the molecule to oscillate, and the re-radiated light is polarized in the plane perpendicular to the scattering direction.

This explains why the sky appears polarized — looking at $90°$ from the sun, the scattered light is most strongly polarized.

Scattering also explains why the **sky is blue**: the scattering intensity goes as $1/\lambda^4$ (Rayleigh scattering), so shorter wavelengths (blue) scatter much more than longer wavelengths (red).

### Birefringence

In some crystalline materials (e.g., calcite), the refractive index depends on the polarization direction of the light. This is **birefringence** (double refraction).

- **Ordinary ray** ($n_o$) — refractive index is the same in all directions; obeys Snell's law normally
- **Extraordinary ray** ($n_e$) — refractive index varies with direction relative to the **optic axis**; does not obey Snell's law in the usual sense

The two rays travel at different speeds through the crystal, acquiring a relative phase difference.

### Circular Polarization and Quarter-Wave Plates

When two perpendicular linearly polarized components are out of phase, the result is **elliptically polarized light**. The tip of the electric field vector traces an ellipse as the wave propagates.

Special cases:

- $\phi = 0$ or $\pi$: linearly polarized
- $\phi = \pm\pi/2$ with equal amplitudes: **circularly polarized** — the field vector rotates in a circle
- Left or right circular polarization depends on which component leads

A **quarter-wave plate** is a birefringent slab whose thickness is chosen so that the ordinary and extraordinary rays acquire a relative phase shift of $\pi/2$ (a quarter wavelength). Sending linearly polarized light at $45°$ to the optic axis through a quarter-wave plate produces circularly polarized light, and vice versa.
