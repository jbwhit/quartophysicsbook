# TODO - Think Like A Physicist

## Status: Phase 3 in progress

---

## Phase 3: Polish & Publish

### Diagrams
- [ ] Replace ~35 remaining diagram placeholders with TikZ (3 done: pendulum, heat engine, light clock)
- [ ] Review all AI-generated diagrams for correctness (remove "Needs Review" callouts after sign-off)

### Practice Problems
- [ ] Add practice problems to remaining chapters (2 done: mechanics, waves)

### Content Review
- [ ] Careful pass on physics correctness (not just fidelity to notes)
- [ ] Pass on consistency (unit conventions, notation, etc.)
- [ ] Write co-author preface (Jonathan + Casey)

### Review All Math
- [ ] Review all derivations and boxed results for correctness

## Open Questions
1. Any topics Casey wants to add beyond what's in the IPhO notes?
2. Error propagation — considered under lab stuff that we're not covering?
