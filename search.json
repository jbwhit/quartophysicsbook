Graphs\nDirections: Mark it (negative/positive)\nDefinitions & Data: Put it on the page (all of them)\nDiagnosis: Type (how) conservation principles, force laws, angular momentum.\nDerivation: Equations (diagnosis in symbols) as many equations as variables add to diagram dimensions\nDetermination - D’algebra - box the answer.\nDimensions - Check and limiting cases – if makes sense then possibly right (if not prob wrong). LHS = RHS then :grinning:.\nSubstitution: if necessary - do rough calc by hand an dunits include error!\n\nWe can cite easily as well, see Knuth (1984) for additional discussion of literate programming.\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
