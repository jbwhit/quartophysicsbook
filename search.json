The mass \\(M\\) experiences kinetic friction characterized by a coefficient \\(\\mu_k\\) with the inclined plane. The piano \\(M\\) is heavy enough that its sliding down the ramp and pulling the man \\(m\\) up. Determine the acceleration \\(a\\) of the system.\n\nDiagram\nTODO: Create a diagram showing the two masses, \\(m\\) and \\(M\\), the inclined plane with angle \\(\\theta\\), and the direction of the frictional force opposing the motion of \\(M\\) up the incline.\n\n\nDirections\nTODO gravity points down\n\nDirection of \\(a\\) for man is vertically upwards.\nDirection of \\(a\\) for piano downward along the incline.\n\n\n\nDefinitions & Data\n\n\\(m\\): Mass hanging from the pulley (kg)\n\\(M\\): Mass on the inclined plane (kg)\n\\(\\theta\\): Angle of the inclined plane from the horizontal (radians)\n\\(\\mu_k\\): Coefficient of kinetic friction\n\\(g\\): Acceleration due to gravity\n\n\n\nDiagnosis\nConsider the forces on each mass and draw a free body diagram:\nTODO FBD\n\nMass \\(m\\): Gravitational force \\(mg\\) and tension \\(T\\).\nMass \\(M\\): Gravitational force component along the incline, normal force, frictional force \\(f_k = \\mu_k N\\), and tension \\(T\\).\nConservation of String: string is the same length, so when pulled the forces are transmitted without diminishing.\n\n\n\nDerivation\n\nWrite down the force equations for each mass.\n\nFor mass \\(m\\): \\(mg - T = ma\\) (Downward force - tension = mass times acceleration).\nFor mass \\(M\\): \\(Mg\\sin(\\theta) - f_k - T = Ma\\) (Component of gravity along incline - friction - tension = mass times acceleration).\n\n\n\\[\\left| F\\right| = \\left(m + M\\right) * \\left|a\\right|\\]\n\\[N = M g \\cos{\\theta}\\]\n\\[T = T\\]\n\\[ \\therefore \\sum{F} = M g \\sin{\\theta}  + \\mu_k N - m g\\]\n\n\nD’algebra\n\\[\\left| F\\right| = \\left(m + M\\right) * \\left|a\\right| = M g \\sin{\\theta}  + \\mu_k N - m g\\]\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\n\\left| a\\right| &= \\frac{M g \\sin{\\theta}  + \\mu_k N - m g}{\\left(m + M\\right)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{M g \\sin{\\theta}  + \\mu_k M g \\cos{\\theta} - m g}{\\left(m + M\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nDetermination\n\\[\\boxed{\\left| a\\right|= g \\left(\\frac{M  \\sin{\\theta}  + \\mu_k M  \\cos{\\theta} - m }{\\left(m + M\\right)}\\right)}\\]\n\n\nDimensions\n\\[LHS = L T^{-2}\\]\n\\[RHS = L T^{-2} \\left(\\frac{M + M - m}{M}\\right)\\]\nLooks right!\n\n\nLimiting Cases\nConsider extreme cases like:\n\nWhat happens when \\(\\theta = 0\\)?\n\nacceleration is difference in weight of the man from the frictional force.
