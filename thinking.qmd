# How to Think Like a Physicist

## SI Units

| Base Quantity | Base Unit Name | Symbol |
|---|---|---|
| **Length** | meter | m |
| **Time** | second | s |
| **Mass** | kilogram | kg |
| **Electric Current** | ampere | A |
| **Thermodynamic Temperature** | kelvin | K |
| **Amount of Substance** | mole | mol |
| **Luminous Intensity** | candela | cd |

The five fundamental units are length (meter, m), time (second, s), mass (kilogram, kg), charge (coulomb, C), and temperature (kelvin, K). Ampere (A), mole (mol), and candela (cd) are derived from these base units.

All other units are derived from combinations of these fundamental units.

| Concept | Unit | Derivation |
|---|---|---|
| **Force** | Newton (N) | $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m} \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$ |
| **Energy** | Joule (J) | $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$ |
| **Power** | Watt (W) | $\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-3}$ |
| **Current** | Ampere (A) | $\text{C} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$ |

## Dimensional Analysis and Sanity Checking

Vital tool for both checking (always!!) and fudging. It is part of a consistency check — units on both sides of the equation must be the same. A successful dimension check is followed by a :).

Similarly, equations with vectors must have the same vector shape on each side.

Math and formulas are a tool, not the final authority. Never formula fit. Understand what is going on and check that the answers are sensible.

## Solving Problems with the 7 Ds and the little s

Using this basic algorithm to approach problems from first principles is the single biggest update you are likely to make to your thinking, ever.^[A more thorough exploration of this algorithm can be found at Casey Handmer's blog post [In Space, No One Can Reason By Analogy](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/10/15/in-space-no-one-can-reason-by-analogy/).]

1. **Diagrams** — Big, 2/3 page, as many as you need. Load the problem into your GPU.
2. **Directions** — Mark it (negative/positive).
3. **Definitions and Given Data** — Put it on the page (all of them).
4. **Diagnosis** — How? What type of problem is this? E.g. conservation principles, force laws, angular momentum.
5. **Derivation** — Write down the fundamental equations, the diagnosis expressed as symbols. You will need as many equations as variables. Add to the diagram if necessary. Check dimensions.
6. **Determination** (or D'algebra) — Math manipulations to get the answer. Box it!
7. **Dimensions** — **Check dimensions and limiting cases/sanity check**. $LHS = RHS$ then :).
8. **substitutions** — Only if necessary, do rough calculation by hand and check units, include an error term.

## Example Problem 1 {.unnumbered}

A body, mass $m$, slides without friction from rest at height $H$ to lower height $h$, colliding with a horizontal spring of strength $k$. By how much does it compress?

## TODO: Diagram

### Definitions & Data {.unnumbered}

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| $m$ | Mass of object |
| $H$ | Initial height |
| $h$ | Final height |
| $k$ | Spring constant |
| $g$ | Acceleration due to gravity ($9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$) |
| $x$ | Compression of spring |
| $U_{gpe}$ | Gravitational potential energy |
| $U_{E}$ | Elastic potential energy |
| $E$ | Energy |

### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Conservation of Energy ($E$ is conserved).

$$U_{gpe} \rightarrow U_{E}$$

$$mgH = mgh + \frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$$

### Derivation {.unnumbered}

$$F = -kx$$

$$\begin{aligned}
U &= -\int F \, \textnormal{d}x\\
&= -\int_{x_i}^{x_{f}} k x \, \textnormal{d}x\\
&= \frac{1}{2}k x_f^2
\end{aligned}$$

### Determination {.unnumbered}

$$mg\left(H -h\right) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2$$

$$\frac{2mg\left(H -h\right)}{k} = x^2$$

$$\boxed{x = \sqrt{\frac{2mg(H-h)}{k}}}$$

### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

$$\begin{aligned}
L &= \sqrt{\frac{M L T^{-2} \left(L\right)}{M T^{-2}}}\\
&= \sqrt{L^2} = L \quad \checkmark
\end{aligned}$$

### Limiting Cases {.unnumbered}

- $H \rightarrow h$: $H - h = 0 \implies x = 0$ — makes sense!
- $m \rightarrow 0 \implies x \rightarrow 0$ — makes sense!
- $k \rightarrow \infty \implies x \rightarrow 0$ — makes sense!
- $k \rightarrow 0 \implies x \rightarrow \infty$ — makes sense!

### Substitution {.unnumbered}
Not needed.


## Example Problem 2 {.unnumbered}

A man (mass $m$) is pulling a piano (mass $M$) up a hill (angle $\theta$ to horizontal), using a pulley. The coefficient of kinetic friction is $\mu_k$.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Diagram showing: (1) Inclined plane at angle $\theta$. (2) Piano (mass $M$) on the incline connected by string over pulley to man (mass $m$) hanging vertically. Include direction arrows and coordinate axes.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Free Body Diagrams
(1) Man: weight $mg$ down, tension $T$ up. (2) Piano: weight $Mg$ decomposed into components along/perpendicular to incline, normal force $N$, friction $\mu_k N$ opposing motion, tension $T$ up the incline.
:::

### Definitions & Data {.unnumbered}

- $m$: Mass of man (kg)
- $M$: Mass of piano (kg)
- $\theta$: Angle of incline from horizontal
- $\mu_k$: Coefficient of kinetic friction
- $g$: Acceleration due to gravity
- $T$: Tension in string
- $N$: Normal force
- $a$: Acceleration of the system

### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Forces: free body diagram. Conservation of string.

- Man: $F = ma$
- Piano: component of gravity along incline, normal force, friction $f_k = \mu_k N$, tension $T$.

### Derivation {.unnumbered}

For the man:
$$ma = mg - T$$
$$T = m(g - a)$$

For the piano:
$$N = Mg\cos\theta$$
$$\sum F = Mg\sin\theta + \mu_k N - mg$$

### Determination {.unnumbered}

$$\boxed{a = g\left(\frac{M\sin\theta + \mu_k M\cos\theta - m}{M + m}\right)}$$

### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

$$LHS = LT^{-2}, \quad RHS = LT^{-2}\left(\frac{M + M - M}{M}\right) \quad \checkmark$$

### Limiting Cases {.unnumbered}

- If $M \gg m$: acceleration to the right (piano dominates). Makes sense.
- If $m \gg M$: acceleration negative (man pulls piano up). Makes sense.
- $\theta = 0$: acceleration depends on friction vs man's weight. Makes sense.
- $\theta = 90°$: reduces to Atwood machine. Makes sense.

This working includes an error caught during the limiting cases check, and left in to show how this works.
