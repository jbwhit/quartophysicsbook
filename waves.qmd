# Waves & Oscillations

## Simple Harmonic Motion

### What Is an Oscillation?

An oscillation is caused by a **restoring force** — a force that acts to return a system to some equilibrium position. At equilibrium the net force is zero; displace the system and it gets pushed back.

**Key variables:**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $T$ | Period — time for one complete oscillation |
| $f$ | Frequency — cycles per second ($\text{Hz}$) |
| $\omega$ | Angular frequency ($\text{rad/s}$) |
| $x_0$ | Amplitude — maximum displacement from equilibrium |
| $\phi$ | Phase constant |
| $\lambda$ | Wavelength |

: Oscillation Variables {.striped .hover}

The period and frequency are related by $T = 1/f$, and the angular frequency is $\omega = 2\pi f$.

### The Simple Harmonic Oscillator

The simplest case: a restoring force proportional to displacement (Hooke's law):

$$F = -kx$$

Newton's second law gives:

$$m\ddot{x} = -kx \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \ddot{x} + \frac{k}{m}x = 0$$

The general solution is:

$$\boxed{x(t) = x_0 \cos(\omega t + \phi), \qquad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}}$$

where $x_0$ and $\phi$ are set by initial conditions.

### Velocity and Acceleration in SHM

Differentiating:

$$v(t) = \dot{x} = -x_0 \omega \sin(\omega t + \phi)$$

$$a(t) = \ddot{x} = -x_0 \omega^2 \cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Three aligned graphs of $x$, $v$, and $a$ vs $t$ for SHM. Show $x$ as a cosine, $v$ as a negative sine (leading $x$ by $\pi/2$), and $a$ as a negative cosine (opposite phase to $x$). Label amplitudes $x_0$, $x_0\omega$, $x_0\omega^2$.
:::

Note the relationships: $v$ leads $x$ by $\pi/2$, and $a$ is exactly out of phase with $x$. Finding the minima and maxima of these functions is a standard exercise.

### Potential Energy in SHM

From $F = -kx$, the potential energy is:

$$U = -\int F\,dx = \int_0^x kx'\,dx'$$

$$\boxed{U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2} = \frac{1}{2}kx_0^2\cos^2(\omega t + \phi)$$

### Energy Conservation in SHM

The total mechanical energy is conserved:

$$E_T = U + K = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Substituting the SHM solutions:

$$E_T = \frac{1}{2}kx_0^2\cos^2(\omega t + \phi) + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x_0^2\sin^2(\omega t + \phi)$$

Since $m\omega^2 = k$, this simplifies to:

$$\boxed{E_T = \frac{1}{2}kx_0^2}$$

The total energy is constant and proportional to the square of the amplitude. Energy sloshes back and forth between kinetic and potential, but their sum never changes.

## The Simple Pendulum

```{.tikz}

  % Arc length label

    node[midway, below right=1pt] {$x = L\theta$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

For a pendulum of length $L$ at angle $\theta$ from vertical, the restoring force along the arc is:

$$F = -mg\sin\theta$$

For **small angles** ($\theta \lesssim 15°$), $\sin\theta \approx \theta$, so:

$$F \approx -mg\theta = -\frac{mg}{L}x$$

where $x = L\theta$ is the arc-length displacement. This is Hooke's law with effective spring constant $k_\text{eff} = mg/L$, giving:

$$\omega^2 = \frac{k_\text{eff}}{m} = \frac{g}{L}$$

$$\boxed{T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}}$$

Note that the period is independent of mass and (for small angles) independent of amplitude. This is why pendulums make good clocks.

## Traveling Waves

### What Is a Wave?

Waves transport **energy and information** without transporting matter. A mechanical wave travels through an elastic medium — particles in the medium oscillate about their equilibrium positions but do not travel with the wave.

**Types:**

- **Transverse** — particle displacement perpendicular to wave propagation (e.g., waves on a string, electromagnetic waves)
- **Longitudinal** — particle displacement parallel to wave propagation (e.g., sound waves, compression in a spring)

Waves can also be classified by:

- **Dimension** — 1D (string), 2D (water surface, concentric circles), 3D (sound, spherical wavefronts)
- **Periodicity** — periodic or pulse
- **Shape of wavefront** — plane, cylindrical, spherical

### The Traveling Wave Equation

A sinusoidal wave traveling in the $+x$ direction:

$$\boxed{y(x,t) = y_0 \sin(kx - \omega t)}$$

where:

- $y_0$ = amplitude
- $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ = wave number
- $\omega = 2\pi f$ = angular frequency

The **phase velocity** (speed of a given phase of the wave):

$$\boxed{v = \frac{\omega}{k} = \lambda f}$$

A snapshot at fixed $t$ shows the spatial pattern; a fixed point at constant $x$ oscillates in time.

### Waves on a Stretched String

For a string under tension $F_T$ with linear mass density $\mu$ (mass per unit length):

$$\boxed{v = \sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}}$$

This is one of the most important wave speed formulas. Greater tension means faster waves; greater mass density means slower waves.

### Energy and Power in Waves

The kinetic energy density of a transverse wave on a string:

$$\frac{dK}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}\mu\omega^2 y_0^2 \cos^2(kx - \omega t)$$

The time-averaged power transmitted by the wave:

$$\boxed{P_\text{avg} = \frac{1}{2}\mu\omega^2 y_0^2 v}$$

### Intensity

For waves spreading in 3D, the **intensity** $I$ is the power per unit area:

$$I = \frac{P_\text{avg}}{A}$$

For a point source radiating uniformly in all directions (spherical wavefront):

$$I = \frac{P_\text{avg}}{4\pi r^2}$$

Intensity falls off as $1/r^2$ — the inverse square law. Since intensity is proportional to amplitude squared, the amplitude of a spherical wave falls off as $1/r$.

## Superposition and Interference

### The Superposition Principle

When two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement at any point is the **sum of the individual displacements**:

$$y_\text{total} = y_1 + y_2 + \cdots$$

This holds for all linear wave equations (i.e., when the restoring force is proportional to displacement).

### Interference

When waves of the same frequency overlap:

- **Constructive interference** — waves in phase, amplitudes add
- **Destructive interference** — waves out of phase, amplitudes cancel

## Standing Waves

### Formation

Two waves of equal amplitude and frequency traveling in **opposite directions** superimpose to form a standing wave:

$$y_1 = y_0\sin(kx - \omega t), \qquad y_2 = y_0\sin(kx + \omega t)$$

Using the product-to-sum identity:

$$\boxed{y(x,t) = 2y_0\sin(kx)\cos(\omega t)}$$

This is the product of a spatial part $\sin(kx)$ (the "shape") and a temporal part $\cos(\omega t)$ (the "breathing"). The wave does not travel — it oscillates in place.

- **Nodes** — points of zero amplitude at all times ($\sin(kx) = 0$, i.e., $kx = n\pi$)
- **Antinodes** — points of maximum displacement ($\sin(kx) = \pm 1$, i.e., $kx = (n+\frac{1}{2})\pi$)

### Reflection at Boundaries

- **Fixed boundary** — a transverse wave undergoes a phase change of $\pi$ upon reflection (inverted)
- **Free boundary** — no phase change upon reflection

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Pulse reflection at fixed vs free boundaries. Show incoming and reflected pulses, with inversion at fixed end and no inversion at free end.
:::

### Resonance

A medium of finite length $L$ supports standing waves only at specific frequencies — the **resonant frequencies** (harmonics).

**Two fixed ends** (or two free ends) — e.g., a stretched string:

$$L = n\frac{\lambda}{2}, \qquad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$

$$\boxed{f_n = \frac{nv}{2L}}$$

The $n = 1$ mode is the **fundamental**; higher $n$ are overtones.

**One closed end, one open end** — e.g., an organ pipe:

$$L = (2n-1)\frac{\lambda}{4}, \qquad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$

$$\boxed{f_n = \frac{(2n-1)v}{4L}}$$

Only odd harmonics are present.

## TODO: Diagram

:::

## Beats

When two waves of **nearly equal frequency** are superimposed, they alternately go in and out of phase, producing a pulsating pattern called **beats**.

For two waves $y_1 = A\cos(\omega_1 t)$ and $y_2 = A\cos(\omega_2 t)$, the sum is:

$$y = y_1 + y_2 = 2A\cos\!\left(\frac{\omega_1 - \omega_2}{2}t\right)\cos\!\left(\frac{\omega_1 + \omega_2}{2}t\right)$$

using the product-to-sum identity $\cos\alpha + \cos\beta = 2\cos\!\left(\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}\right)\cos\!\left(\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\right)$.

::: {.callout-warning}
## TODO: Diagram
Beat pattern: two waves of slightly different frequency (top), and their superposition showing the amplitude envelope (bottom). Label the beat frequency.
:::

The result is a wave at the **average frequency** $\bar{f} = (f_1 + f_2)/2$, with an amplitude that oscillates at the **beat frequency**:

$$\boxed{f_\text{beat} = |f_1 - f_2|}$$

You hear one beat per cycle of the envelope. Since the envelope goes through two maxima per cycle of $\cos\!\left(\frac{\omega_1 - \omega_2}{2}t\right)$, the beat frequency is the difference (not half the difference) of the two frequencies.

## The Doppler Effect

The **Doppler effect** is the apparent shift in frequency due to relative motion between a source and an observer. Let $V$ be the speed of sound in the medium.

### Moving Source, Stationary Observer

A source moving at speed $V_s$ toward the observer compresses the wavelength in front:

$$\lambda' = \lambda - \frac{V_s}{f} = \lambda\left(1 - \frac{V_s}{V}\right)$$

The observed frequency increases:

$$f' = \frac{V}{\lambda'} = f\frac{V}{V - V_s}$$

### Moving Observer, Stationary Source

An observer moving at speed $V_o$ toward the source encounters crests more frequently:

$$f' = \frac{V + V_o}{\lambda} = f\frac{V + V_o}{V}$$

### General Doppler Formula

For both source and observer moving (with velocities taken as positive when toward each other):

$$\boxed{f' = f\,\frac{V - V_o}{V - V_s}}$$

where $V_o$ is positive when the observer moves **away** from the source, and $V_s$ is positive when the source moves **toward** the observer. (Sign convention: define the positive direction as from source to observer. Then $V_s > 0$ means the source chases the wave, reducing wavelength; $V_o > 0$ means the observer flees the wave, reducing observed frequency.)

**Limiting cases:**

- Source approaching ($V_s > 0$, $V_o = 0$): $f' > f$ — pitch increases
- Source receding ($V_s < 0$, $V_o = 0$): $f' < f$ — pitch decreases
- Observer approaching ($V_o < 0$, $V_s = 0$): $f' > f$
- $V_s \to V$: $f' \to \infty$ — sonic boom (Mach 1)

#### Diagram {.unnumbered}

See placeholder above.

#### Directions {.unnumbered}

Not needed — purely scalar problem (frequency has no direction).

#### Definitions & Given Data {.unnumbered}

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $L$ | Length of string (m) |
| $F_T$ | Tension in string (N) |
| $\mu$ | Linear mass density (kg/m) |
| $v$ | Wave speed on string (m/s) |
| $f_1$ | Fundamental frequency (Hz) |

: {.striped .hover}

#### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Two results combine: the wave speed on a string ($v = \sqrt{F_T/\mu}$) and the resonance condition for a string fixed at both ends ($f_n = nv/(2L)$, with $n=1$ for the fundamental).

#### Derivation {.unnumbered}

Wave speed on a stretched string:

$$v = \sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}$$

Resonance condition for two fixed ends (fundamental, $n = 1$):

$$f_1 = \frac{v}{2L}$$

#### Determination {.unnumbered}

$$\boxed{f_1 = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}}$$

#### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

- $[f_1] = \frac{1}{[\text{m}]}\sqrt{\frac{[\text{N}]}{[\text{kg/m}]}} = \frac{1}{[\text{m}]}\sqrt{\frac{[\text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}^2]}{[\text{kg/m}]}} = \frac{1}{[\text{m}]} \cdot [\text{m/s}] = [\text{s}^{-1}]$ ✓
- Increasing $F_T$ increases $f_1$ — tighter strings are higher-pitched ✓
- Increasing $\mu$ decreases $f_1$ — heavier strings are lower-pitched ✓
- Increasing $L$ decreases $f_1$ — longer strings are lower-pitched ✓

#### Substitution {.unnumbered}

For a typical high-E guitar string ($L = 0.65\;\text{m}$, $F_T = 70\;\text{N}$, $\mu = 3.9 \times 10^{-4}\;\text{kg/m}$):

$$f_1 = \frac{1}{2 \times 0.65}\sqrt{\frac{70}{3.9 \times 10^{-4}}} \approx \frac{1}{1.3} \times 424 \approx 326\;\text{Hz}$$

This is close to the expected E4 ($\approx 330\;\text{Hz}$) ✓

#### Definitions & Given Data {.unnumbered}

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $f_1 = 440\;\text{Hz}$ | Frequency of fork 1 |

| $f_\text{beat}$ | Beat frequency (Hz) |
| $T_\text{beat}$ | Time between maxima (s) |

: {.striped .hover}

#### Diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Superposition of two waves of nearly equal frequency produces beats. The beat frequency is the absolute difference of the individual frequencies.

#### Derivation {.unnumbered}

From the superposition result derived earlier:

$$f_\text{beat} = |f_1 - f_2|$$

The time between successive maxima is one beat period:

$$T_\text{beat} = \frac{1}{f_\text{beat}}$$

#### Determination {.unnumbered}

$$\boxed{f_\text{beat} = |f_1 - f_2|}$$

$$\boxed{T_\text{beat} = \frac{1}{|f_1 - f_2|}}$$

#### Dimensions {.unnumbered}

- $[f_\text{beat}] = [\text{Hz}]$ ✓
- $[T_\text{beat}] = [\text{s}]$ ✓
- If $f_1 = f_2$: $f_\text{beat} = 0$ — no beats, constant loudness ✓
- As $|f_1 - f_2|$ increases, beats become faster and eventually indistinguishable — the ear hears two separate tones ✓

#### Substitution {.unnumbered}

$$f_\text{beat} = |440 - 444| = 4\;\text{Hz}$$

$$T_\text{beat} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25\;\text{s}$$

You hear 4 pulses of loudness per second, spaced 0.25 seconds apart.
