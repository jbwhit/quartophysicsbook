## Phase 0: Project Setup & Structure (COMPLETE)
- [x] Restructure repo root as Quarto project
- [x] Archive old attempts (`firstdraft/`, `old-qph/`, `physicsthinking/`, `repo/`, `quartophysicsbook/`) into `_archive/`
- [x] Set up `_quarto.yml` with dual output (website + PDF book)
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions deploy workflow
- [x] Create chapter structure with parts
- [x] Initialize git repo at root, initial commit, push to GitHub
- [x] Verify `quarto preview` works locally
