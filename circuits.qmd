# Circuits & Magnetism

## DC Circuits

### Current and Voltage

An **electric circuit** is a closed loop through which charge flows, transferring electrical energy. **Current** $I$ is the flow of positive charge:

$$I = \frac{dq}{dt}$$

measured in **amperes** (A = C/s).

**Voltage** $V$ is the electric potential difference between two points, measured in **volts** (V). It is an intensive quantity — the energy per unit charge.

### Ohm's Law

The voltage across a resistor is proportional to the current through it:

$$\boxed{V = IR}$$

where $R$ is the **resistance** (in ohms, $\Omega$). Resistors convert electrical energy into heat.

### Power Dissipation

The power dissipated in a resistor:

$$\boxed{P = IV = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}}$$

These three forms are equivalent via Ohm's law. Use whichever is most convenient given the known quantities.

### EMF and Internal Resistance

A **cell** (battery) is a DC source with electromotive force (EMF) $\mathcal{E}$. An ideal battery maintains constant potential $\mathcal{E}$, giving $I = \mathcal{E}/R$.

A real battery has **internal resistance** $r$. The terminal voltage is:

$$V = \mathcal{E} - Ir$$

If $r$ is comparable to $R$, significant power is dissipated inside the battery. With no current flowing (open circuit), $V = \mathcal{E}$.

### Kirchhoff's Laws

**Kirchhoff's junction rule** (charge conservation): The total current entering a junction equals the total current leaving:

$$\sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out}$$

**Kirchhoff's loop rule** (energy conservation): The sum of potential differences around any closed loop is zero:

$$\sum \Delta V = 0$$

No perpetual motion — what goes up must come down.

### Resistors in Series and Parallel

**Series** (same current through each):

$$\boxed{R_\text{series} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots}$$

**Parallel** (same voltage across each):

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{R_\text{parallel}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots}$$

Complex circuits can be solved by finding the effective resistance, or by applying Kirchhoff's laws directly (which may require solving systems of equations — matrix methods work well).

### Measurements

A **voltmeter** measures voltage and has very high resistance (ideally infinite) — it draws negligible current. An **ammeter** measures current and has very low resistance (ideally zero) — it doesn't affect the circuit. In practice, neither is perfect.

## Capacitors and Inductors

### Capacitors

A **capacitor** stores energy in an electric field. The voltage across a capacitor is:

$$V = \frac{q}{C}$$

where $C$ is the **capacitance**. (See the Electrostatics chapter for the derivation of $C = \varepsilon_0 A/d$ for parallel plates.)

**Capacitors in series:**

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{C_\text{series}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots}$$

**Capacitors in parallel:**

$$\boxed{C_\text{parallel} = C_1 + C_2 + \cdots}$$

Note: capacitors combine opposite to resistors — series adds reciprocals, parallel adds directly.

Energy stored in a capacitor:

$$\boxed{U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{q^2}{C}}$$

### Inductors

An **inductor** stores energy in a magnetic field. The voltage across an inductor is:

$$\boxed{V = L\frac{dI}{dt}}$$

where $L$ is the **inductance** (in henries, H). This has the same form as $V = q/C$ for capacitors, but with current replacing charge and a time derivative.

**Inductors in series:**

$$\boxed{L_\text{series} = L_1 + L_2 + \cdots}$$

**Inductors in parallel:**

$$\boxed{\frac{1}{L_\text{parallel}} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2} + \cdots}$$

Inductors combine like resistors — series adds directly, parallel adds reciprocals.

Energy stored in an inductor:

$$\boxed{U = \frac{1}{2}LI^2}$$

## Transient Circuits

Transients happen once, then the circuit reaches equilibrium.

### RC Circuit

## TODO: Diagram

:::

Applying Kirchhoff's loop rule to a charging RC circuit:

$$V = IR + \frac{q}{C} = 0$$

Since $I = dq/dt$, this gives a first-order ODE. Solving with the initial condition $q(0) = 0$:

$$\boxed{q(t) = CV\left(1 - e^{-t/RC}\right)}$$

The **time constant** $\tau = RC$ sets the charging timescale. After one time constant, the capacitor has charged to $\approx 63\%$ ($1 - 1/e$) of its final value. Small $\tau$ means fast charging.

**Discharging** (remove the battery): $q(t) = CV\, e^{-t/RC}$.

### RL Circuit

## TODO: Diagram
RL circuit with battery, switch, resistor $R$, and inductor $L$. Show current curve $I(t) = (V/R)(1 - e^{-Rt/L})$ approaching $V/R$ asymptotically. Mark the time constant $\tau = L/R$.
:::

Applying Kirchhoff's loop rule:

$$V = IR + L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

Solving with $I(0) = 0$:

$$\boxed{I(t) = \frac{V}{R}\left(1 - e^{-Rt/L}\right)}$$

The time constant is $\tau = L/R$. After one time constant, the current has reached $\approx 63\%$ of its final value $V/R$.

**Discharging** (remove the battery): $I(t) = (V/R)\,e^{-Rt/L}$.

### LC Circuit

An LC circuit with no resistance is **oscillatory** — the energy sloshes between the capacitor (electric field) and inductor (magnetic field):

$$\frac{q}{C} + L\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$$

Since $I = dq/dt$:

$$\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \frac{q}{LC} = 0$$

This is the SHM equation with:

$$\boxed{\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}}$$

Adding resistance gives a damped RLC circuit, which decays to the LC oscillation (see AC circuits below).

## Magnetostatics

### Magnetic Fields

Magnets produce **magnetic fields** $\vec{B}$, measured in **tesla** (T). Unlike electric charges, there are no magnetic monopoles — magnetic field lines always form closed loops (north to south outside the magnet, south to north inside).

::: {.callout-warning}

:::

### The Lorentz Force

A charged particle moving in electric and magnetic fields experiences the **Lorentz force**:

$$\boxed{\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v}\times\vec{B})}$$

The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity — it can change the direction of motion but **cannot do work** (since $\vec{F}\cdot\vec{v} = q(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})\cdot\vec{v} = 0$).

A particle moving perpendicular to a uniform $\vec{B}$ follows a **circular path**: the magnetic force provides centripetal acceleration.

### Drift Velocity and Current-Carrying Wires

In a conductor, current arises from the **drift velocity** $v_d$ of charge carriers. For $n$ carriers per unit volume in a wire of cross-sectional area $A$:

$$I = nqv_d A$$

The force on a current-carrying wire of length $\vec{L}$ in a magnetic field:

$$\boxed{\vec{F} = I\vec{L}\times\vec{B}}$$

### The Biot–Savart Law

A current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field. The contribution from an infinitesimal element $d\vec{l}$ carrying current $I$:

$$\boxed{d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\frac{I\,d\vec{l}\times\hat{r}}{r^2}}$$

where $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}\;\text{T}\cdot\text{m/A}$ is the **permeability of free space**.

### Magnetic Field of a Long Straight Wire

Integrating the Biot–Savart law for an infinite straight wire:

$$\boxed{B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi d}}$$

where $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the wire. The field wraps around the wire (right-hand rule).

### Force Between Parallel Conductors

Two parallel wires carrying currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ separated by distance $d$ exert a force per unit length on each other:

$$\boxed{\frac{F}{L} = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi}\frac{I_1 I_2}{d}}$$

Parallel currents attract; antiparallel currents repel. This force was historically used to define the ampere.

### Ampère's Law

The magnetic analogue of Gauss's law — relates the line integral of $\vec{B}$ around a closed loop to the enclosed current:

$$\boxed{\oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s} = \mu_0 I_\text{enc}}$$

Like Gauss's law, this is always true but most *useful* when symmetry makes $\vec{B}$ constant along the path and parallel (or perpendicular) to $d\vec{s}$.

### Solenoids

A **solenoid** is a tightly wound coil of wire. Inside an ideal solenoid (infinite length, negligible edge effects), the field is uniform and parallel to the axis. Outside, it's approximately zero.

Applying Ampère's law to a rectangular path:

$$BL = \mu_0 N I$$

where $N$ is the number of turns enclosed by the path and $n = N/L$ is the number of turns per unit length:

$$\boxed{B = \mu_0 n I}$$

The field depends only on the current and turn density — not on the radius.

### Magnetic Dipoles

A current loop has a **magnetic dipole moment**:

$$\vec{\mu} = I\vec{A}$$

where $\vec{A}$ is the area vector (direction by right-hand rule). Far from the loop, the field has the same structure as an electric dipole field.

In an external field, a magnetic dipole experiences a **torque**:

$$\boxed{\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu}\times\vec{B}}$$

This is the principle behind **electric motors** — current loops in magnetic fields experience torques that produce rotation.

The **potential energy** of a magnetic dipole:

$$\boxed{U = -\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}}$$

Minimum energy when $\vec{\mu} \parallel \vec{B}$ (aligned); maximum when antiparallel.

## Electromagnetic Induction

### Magnetic Flux

The **magnetic flux** through a surface:

$$\Phi_B = \oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}$$

If $\vec{B}$ is uniform and perpendicular to a flat area $A$: $\Phi_B = BA$.

### Faraday's Law

A changing magnetic flux through a loop induces an EMF:

$$\boxed{\mathcal{E} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}}$$

The flux can change by changing $B$, changing the area $A$, or changing the orientation.

### Lenz's Law

The direction of the induced EMF **opposes** the change in magnetic flux that caused it. This is a consequence of conservation of energy — if it aided the change, we'd get energy for free.

## TODO: Diagram

:::

### Motional EMF

A wire of length $h$ moving with velocity $v_0$ perpendicular to a magnetic field $B$ develops an EMF:

$$\mathcal{E} = Bhv_0$$

If this wire is part of a circuit with resistance $R$, the induced current is $I = Bhv_0/R$, and the force required to maintain constant velocity:

$$\boxed{F = \frac{B^2h^2v_0}{R}}$$

### Inductance

**Inductance** $L$ quantifies how much flux a coil produces per unit current — it is a geometric property, analogous to capacitance. The induced EMF is:

$$\mathcal{E} = -L\frac{dI}{dt}$$

For a solenoid of $N$ turns, length $\ell$, and cross-sectional area $\pi R^2$:

$$\Phi_B = \mu_0 n I \cdot \pi R^2, \qquad N\Phi_B = \mu_0 n^2 \pi R^2 \ell \cdot I$$

$$\boxed{L = \mu_0 n^2 \pi R^2 \ell}$$

### Mutual Inductance

Two coils can couple magnetically. If the flux through coil 2 due to coil 1 is $\Phi_2 = MI_1$, then:

$$\mathcal{E}_2 = -M\frac{dI_1}{dt}$$

Mutual inductance is **symmetric**: $M_{12} = M_{21} = M$. The coupling constant $k \leq 1$ measures how much flux from one coil threads the other. This is the principle behind **transformers**.

### Magnetic Materials

Inserting magnetic materials into solenoids changes the field, analogous to dielectrics in capacitors:

- **Diamagnetic**: No intrinsic dipole moment; applied field induces a slight opposing field. Weakly reduces $B$. (e.g., water)
- **Paramagnetic**: Dipoles align with applied field, slightly strengthening it. (e.g., aluminum)
- **Ferromagnetic**: Dipoles have large-scale order in domains, greatly increasing $B$. (e.g., iron)

The permeability becomes $\mu = \kappa_m \mu_0$, and inductance scales accordingly: $L = \kappa_m L_0$.

### Energy in a Magnetic Field

The energy stored in an inductor:

$$U = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$$

Using $B = \mu_0 nI$ and $L = \mu_0 n^2 \pi R^2 \ell$, the **energy density** (energy per unit volume) of the magnetic field:

$$\boxed{u_B = \frac{1}{2\mu_0}B^2}$$

Compare with the electric field energy density $u_E = \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0 E^2$.

## AC Circuits

### Alternating Current

In AC circuits, the voltage source varies sinusoidally:

$$V = V_0\cos(\omega t)$$

It is convenient to use **complex notation**: $V = V_0 e^{i\omega t}$ (taking the real part at the end). The current also varies sinusoidally: $I = I_0 e^{i(\omega t + \phi)}$, where $\phi$ is the phase difference between current and voltage.

### Impedance

Redefine Ohm's law for AC using **impedance** $Z$ (the AC generalization of resistance):

$$V = IZ$$

Each circuit element has an impedance:

| Element | Impedance | Reactance |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Resistor | $Z_R = R$ | — |
| Inductor | $Z_L = i\omega L$ | $X_L = \omega L$ |
| Capacitor | $Z_C = \dfrac{1}{i\omega C} = \dfrac{-i}{\omega C}$ | $X_C = \dfrac{1}{\omega C}$ |

: AC Impedances {.striped .hover}

**Reactance** is the magnitude of the imaginary part of impedance. It pulls the current out of phase with the voltage. Impedances combine just like resistances — in series add directly, in parallel add reciprocals.

Kirchhoff's laws still work with impedances.

### Phase Relationships

- **Resistor**: Current and voltage are **in phase** ($\phi = 0$)
- **Inductor**: Voltage **leads** current by $90°$ (current lags)
- **Capacitor**: Current **leads** voltage by $90°$ (voltage lags)

The mnemonic: **ELI the ICE man** — voltage (E) leads current (I) in an inductor (L); current (I) leads voltage (E) in a capacitor (C).

:::

### Series RLC Circuit

For a series RLC circuit:

$$Z = R + i\omega L + \frac{1}{i\omega C} = R + i\left(\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\right)$$

The magnitude and phase:

$$|Z| = \sqrt{R^2 + \left(\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\right)^2}, \qquad \tan\phi = \frac{\omega L - 1/(\omega C)}{R}$$

The current amplitude is $I_0 = V_0/|Z|$.

### Resonance

The current is maximized when the impedance is minimized — when the reactive parts cancel:

$$\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}$$

$$\boxed{\omega_\text{res} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}}$$

At resonance: $|Z| = R$ (purely resistive), $\phi = 0$ (current in phase with voltage), and the power factor $\cos\phi = 1$ (maximum power transfer). This is the same frequency as the LC oscillation.

### Power in AC Circuits

The instantaneous power $P = IV$ oscillates. The time-averaged power:

$$\boxed{P_\text{avg} = \frac{1}{2}V_0 I_0 \cos\phi = V_\text{rms} I_\text{rms} \cos\phi}$$

where $\cos\phi$ is the **power factor**. Only the resistive component dissipates power — reactive elements (inductors, capacitors) store and release energy without net dissipation.

### RMS Values

The **root-mean-square** value of a sinusoidal quantity:

$$\boxed{V_\text{rms} = \frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}}}$$

This is the value reported by AC voltmeters and the standard for household voltage (e.g., 120 V is $V_\text{rms}$, so $V_0 \approx 170$ V). Same for current: $I_\text{rms} = I_0/\sqrt{2}$.

### Frequency Filtering

Impedance depends on frequency, making circuits natural **filters**:

- **Low frequency** ($\omega \to 0$): $Z_C \to \infty$ (capacitor blocks), $Z_L \to 0$ (inductor passes)
- **High frequency** ($\omega \to \infty$): $Z_C \to 0$ (capacitor passes), $Z_L \to \infty$ (inductor blocks)

A capacitive line filter protects circuits from high-frequency interference by shorting it to ground.

## Maxwell's Equations and Electromagnetic Waves

### Energy Density of the Electric Field

From the parallel-plate capacitor ($U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2$, $C = \varepsilon_0 A/d$, $V = Ed$):

$$U = \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0 E^2 \cdot (Ad)$$

The **energy density** of the electric field:

$$\boxed{u_E = \frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_0 E^2}$$

### Maxwell's Equations

The four equations governing all of electromagnetism (in integral form, for free space):

$$\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q}{\varepsilon_0} \qquad \text{(Gauss's law)}$$

$$\oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A} = 0 \qquad \text{(No magnetic monopoles)}$$

$$\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{s} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \qquad \text{(Faraday's law)}$$

$$\oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} \qquad \text{(Ampère–Maxwell law)}$$

The last equation includes Maxwell's crucial addition: the **displacement current** $\mu_0\varepsilon_0\, d\Phi_E/dt$. A changing electric field creates a magnetic field, just as a changing magnetic field creates an electric field (Faraday's law). This symmetry is what makes electromagnetic waves possible.

### Displacement Current

Consider a charging capacitor: current flows in the wire but not between the plates. Yet the magnetic field must be continuous. Maxwell resolved this by noting that the changing electric field between the plates acts like a current:

$$I_d = \varepsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$$

Applying Ampère's law with the displacement current gives the same result whether the surface passes through the wire or between the plates.

### Electromagnetic Waves

From Faraday's law and the Ampère–Maxwell law in free space (no charges or currents), taking derivatives:

$$\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x^2} = \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial t^2}$$

This is the **wave equation** with speed:

$$\boxed{c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}}$$

Plugging in the values: $c \approx 3 \times 10^8$ m/s — the speed of light. Light is an electromagnetic wave.

The solutions are sinusoidal:

$$E = E_0\sin(kx - \omega t), \qquad B = B_0\sin(kx - \omega t)$$

Key properties:

- $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are **perpendicular** to each other and to the direction of propagation
- $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$ are **in phase** (both zero and both maximum at the same points)
- Their amplitudes are related: $E_0 = cB_0$
- Energy density is shared equally between $E$ and $B$

### The Poynting Vector

The **Poynting vector** gives the direction and rate of energy transport:

$$\boxed{\vec{S} = \frac{1}{\mu_0}\vec{E}\times\vec{B}}$$

The time-averaged intensity (power per unit area):

$$\boxed{I = \langle S \rangle = \frac{E_\text{rms}^2}{c\mu_0} = c\varepsilon_0 E_\text{rms}^2}$$

The Poynting vector also explains energy flow into circuit elements. For a solenoid being charged, the Poynting vector points inward at the surface — energy flows from the electromagnetic field into the inductor, consistent with $U = \frac{1}{2}LI^2$.
